# [Bazel](https://bazel.build)

*{Fast, Correct} - Choose two*

Build and test software of any size, quickly and reliably.

* **Speed up the builds and tests**:
  Bazel rebuilds only what is necessary.
  With advanced local and distributed caching, optimized dependency analysis and
  parallel execution, you get fast and incremental builds.

* **One tool, multiple languages**: Build and test Java, C++, Android, iOS, Go,
  and a wide variety of other language platforms. Bazel runs on Windows, macOS,
  and Linux.

* **Scalable**: Bazel helps you scale your organization, codebase, and
  continuous integration solution. It handles codebases of any size, in multiple
  repositories or a huge monorepo.

* **Extensible to your needs**: Easily add support for new languages and
  platforms with Bazel's familiar extension language. Share and re-use language
  rules written by the growing Bazel community.
