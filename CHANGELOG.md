Release Notes:

+ Automatic code cleanup. (#18417)

+ Options specified on the pseudo-command `common` in `.rc` files are now ignored by commands that do not support them as long as they are valid options for *any* Bazel command. Previously, commands that did not support all options given for `common` would fail to run. These previous semantics of `common` are now available via the new `always` pseudo-command. Closes #18130.

+ Additional source inputs can now be specified for compilation in cc_library targets using the additional_compiler_inputs attribute, and these inputs can be used in the $(location) function. Fixes #18766. (#18882)
+ Open-source Google test `ConvenienceSymlinkTest` (#18890)

     Add temporary rules_go bazel_dep to restore CI
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Loading `.bzl` files under `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk` in WORKSPACE
    now requires `rules_java` to be defined in advance.
  - cc_binary targets with dynamic_deps attributes no longer link
    indirect dynamic_deps on Unix. This might be an incompatible
    change if you are using RUNPATHs (instead of RPATHs) in your
    cc_shared_libraries. Enable the feature
    "exclude_bazel_rpaths_in_transitive_libs" or
    "use_rpath_instead_of_runpath" for those cc_shared_libraries.

Important changes:

  - Add aquery --output=streamed_proto which writes a stream of
    length delimited ActionGraphContainer containing a single
    Artifact, Action, Target, DepSetOfFiles, Configuration,
    AspectDescriptor, RuleClass, PathFragment proto. This breaks up
    the ActionGraphContainer into multiple which will prevent large
    protos from crashing blaze.
  - (BEP) TargetConfigured events will be marked aborted instead
    of published when there is an analysis error. This is motivated
    by a
    low level Blaze change aimed at improving scalability.
  - Add flag --experimental_collect_code_coverage_for_generated_files.
  - Added a new output format for cquery --output=streamed_proto that
    writes multiple length-delimited CqueryResult protos, each
    containing a single ConfiguredTarget or Configuration. This
    allows us to "bypass" the hard limit of 2GB on the size of
    protocol buffers by splitting it up into multiple.
  - Enable starlark_doc_extract - a native rule for Starlark
    documentation
    extraction. This rule is intended mainly for internal use by
    Stardoc.

Incompatible changes:

  - `--incompatible_check_sharding_support` is enabled by default.
    Sharded tests with test runners that do not properly advertise
    support for test sharding will fail. Refer to
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/18339 for migration
    advice.

Important changes:

  - Options specified on the pseudo-command `common` in `.rc` files
    are now ignored by commands that do not support them as long as
    they are valid options for *any* Bazel command. Previously,
    commands that did not support all options given for `common`
    would fail to run. These previous semantics of `common` are now
    available via the new `always` pseudo-command.
  - the 'default' param of json.decode can now be used as a keyword
    parameter.
  - As a transitional step in a larger refactoring, rule transitions
    are applied twice. Once during dependency resolution and once
    right before
    analysis of those rules. After the refactoring is complete, rule
    transitions
    will be applied only once.

Incompatible changes:

  - This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful
    builds from
    ```
    FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully (0 packages loaded)
    ```
    to

  - the --experimental_async_execution flag is now a no-op.
  - --experimental_replay_action_out_err is not a no-op.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped to true.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - When multiple --deleted_packages options are passed on the
    command line, they will be concatenated instead of the latest one
    taking effect.
  - This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful
    builds from
  - JSON profile: Use doubles instead of strings for counter series.
  - query --output=proto --order_output=deps now returns targets in
    topological order (previously there was no ordering).
  - --experimental_build_transitive_python_runfiles is flipped to
    false. See #16303 for details
  - --incompatible_python_disable_py2 is flipped to true. See #17293
    for details.
  - When remote cache evicts blobs, Bazel will exit with code 39.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - Bazel's local CPU resource on Linux is now container aware. Use
    `--local_cpu_resources`, `--loading_phase_threads` or `--jobs` to
    override.
  - `copy_from_rule` is exec_groups is deprecated
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17668).
  - --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op
  - --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op
  - --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op
  - `--experimental_execution_graph_log` no longer exists. Current
    users that want local logs need to pass
    `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log
    --experimental_execution_graph_log_path=/some/local/path`.
    Current users that want logs uploaded to BEP need to pass
    `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads`.
  - Remove 'darwin' as a CPU value, use 'darwin_x86_64' instead
  - Remove high priority workers functionality from blaze.
  - Renamed PackageMetrics proto message to PackageLoadMetrics. The
    formats should be wire compatible.

New features:

  - The `aquery` and `cquery` commands now respect the
    `--query_file` flag just like the `query` command.
  - --experimental_repository_disable_download is now promoted to
    stable and is also available under the name
    --repository_disable_download .

Important changes:

  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - removed outdated ctx.host_fragments
  - removed outdated ctx.host_configuration
  - Now that the host configuration is finished, `genrule` should
    prefer the use of `tools` and stop using `exec_tools`.
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.
  - Update Android manifest merger to v30.1.3, and also drop support
    for legacy (pre-D8) desugaring.
  - Adds coverage metric support to android_local_test
  - Correctly encode double value positive infinity as "inf" instead
    of "+inf" for textprotos.
  - Add --use_target_platform_for_tests which uses the target
    platform for executing tests instead of the execution platform.
  - Custom C++ rules on Windows calling
    cc_common.create_linking_context_from_compilation_outputs should
    review whether each target of the rule type should produce a
    dynamic library since a condition which blocked their creation
    has been moved to the rules from behind the API.
  - Add flag `--experimental_remote_cache_ttl` and set the default
    value to 3 hours.
  - making --incompatible_use_platforms_repo_for_constraints do
    nothing. Using constraints from @bazel_tools//platforms with or
    without the flag will throw error with message "Constraints from
    @bazel_tools//platforms have been removed. Please use constraints
    from @platforms repository embedded in Bazel, or preferably
    declare dependency on https://github.com/bazelbuild/platforms"
  - Fixed an issue where WORKSPACE and WORKSPACE-loaded .bzl files
    couldn't see the Bzlmod root module's mappings when Bzlmod is
    enabled.
  - Subsequent settings of --extra_execution_platforms now override
    previous settings, instead of adding them to a list. If you
    currently set --extra_execution_platforms more than once, please
    migrate by passing a list of values to
    --extra_execution_platforms instead so that earlier values aren't
    overwritten.
  - @bazel_tools//config:common_settings.bzl has been removed.
    Use @bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl instead.
  - cc_shared_library is no longer experimental, see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16709 for details
  - The flag `--distinct_host_configuration` is removed. It has been
    a no-op since Bazel 6.0.0.
  - Added `native.module_name()` and `native.module_version()` to
    allow BUILD macro authors to acquire information about which
    Bazel module the current repo is associated with.
  - Add `--skip_incompatible_explicit_targets` option
  - Remove 'darwin' as a CPU value, use 'darwin_x86_64' instead
  - cc_test can now be configured by using a native.toolchain().
  - `@foo` labels can now be used on the command line as the
    top-level target (that is, `bazel build @foo` now works).
    Double-dot syntax is now forbidden (`bazel build ../foo` will no
    longer work).
  - The location of rules that explicitly specify `generator_name`
    and/or `generator_function` attributes (typically because they
    are incidentally copied from `native.existing_rule()`) is now the
    top-level call in the `BUILD` file, which is consistent with
    rules that do not explicitly specify these attributes.
  - Warnings (most notably those associated with the `deprecation`
    rule attribute) are no longer replayed on subsequent invocations
    unless the target in question is re-analyzed. Warnings are purely
    informational, so this change has no bearing on the correctness
    of the build. Downstream tests that break due to this change
    should update their expectations.
  - `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload` has been renamed to
    `--remote_build_event_upload`
  - [Breaking change] platform, constraint_setting, and
    constraint_value can no longer take an applicable_licenses value.
    Remediation is to remove the attribute and rely on the package
    level default.
  - `--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata` has been
    renamed to `--action_cache_store_output_metadata`
  - Changed the default value for `--remote_build_event_upload` to
    `minimal`.
  - `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` has been renamed to
    `--remote_cache_compression`
  - The REPO.bazel and MODULE.bazel files are now also considered
    workspace boundary markers.
  - Added a new `max_compatibility_level` attribute to the
    `bazel_dep` directive, which allows version selection to upgrade
    a dependency up to the specified compatibility level.
  - `--experimental_remote_grpc_log` has been renamed to
    `--remote_grpc_log`
  - `--incompatible_remote_build_event_upload_respect_no_cache` is
    now a no-op.
  - json.decode now takes an optional `default` positional parameter;
    if this parameter is specified and decoding fails, json.decode
    will return
    the `default` value instead of failing Starlark evaluation.
  - Overrides specified by non-root modules no longer cause an error,
    and are silently ignored instead. They were originally treated as
    an error to allow for the future possibility of overrides in the
    transitive dependency graph working together; but we've deemed
    that infeasible (and even if it was, it'd be so complicated and
    confusing to users that it would not be a good addition).
  - `applicable_licenses` is no longer allowed on the `platform` rule.
    Additionally, `default_package_metadata` from any `package` rule
    will not be applied.

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel no longer increases the delay between progress updates when
    there is no cursor control.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped
    to true. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for
    details.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
    
    Closes #16602.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13839
    
    Closes #16626.

New features:

  - The aquery and cquery commands now respect the --query_file flag
    just like the query command.

Important changes:

  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
    
    Work towards #16124
    Fixes #10923
    
    Closes #16428.
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.
  - Adds coverage metric support to android_local_test
  - Fixed an issue where WORKSPACE and WORKSPACE-loaded .bzl files
    couldn't see the Bzlmod root module's mappings when Bzlmod is
    enabled.
  - Added `native.module_name()` and `native.module_version()` to
    allow BUILD macro authors to acquire information about which
    Bazel module the current repo is associated with.
  - `@foo` labels can now be used on the command line as the
    top-level target (that is, `bazel build @foo` now works).
    Double-dot syntax is now forbidden (`bazel build ../foo` will no
    longer work).
  - Added preliminary support for a lockfile for Bzlmod. It's
    disabled by default; use `--lockfile_mode=update` to enable it.
    This lockfile contains only Bazel module information; it does not
    involve module extensions.
  - Added a new `max_compatibility_level` attribute to the
    `bazel_dep` directive, which allows version selection to upgrade
    a dependency up to the specified compatibility level.
    
    Co-authored-by: Brentley Jones <github@brentleyjones.com>
  - `--experimental_remote_grpc_log` has been renamed to
    `--remote_grpc_log`

  - json.decode now takes an optional `default` positional parameter;
    if this parameter is specified and decoding fails, json.decode
    will return
    the `default` value instead of failing Starlark evaluation.

## Release 7.0.0-pre.20230417.1 (2023-04-25)

```
Baseline: 0a47a1fb04efef598376d4ee7b383add1febcc6c
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Removing java_common.javac_jar Starlark call.
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change
    because there is some code that relies on the precise type
    returned, including brittle workarounds for this bug specifically
    and insufficiently flexible workarounds for other issues with the
    intersection of select and native.existing_rule.
  - flipped incompatible_use_toolchain_resolution_for_java_rules, see
    #7849
  - Query output=xml/proto/location for source files will now show
    the location of line 1 of the source file (as the new default)
    instead of its location in the BUILD file.
  - Specifying a target pattern underneath a directory specified by
    .bazelignore will now emit a warning, not an error.
  - Query `--order_output=auto` will now sort lexicographically.
    However, when `somepath` is used as a top level function (e.g.
    `query 'somepath(a, b)'`), it will continue to output in
    dependency order. If you do not want the lexicographical output
    ordering, specify another `--order_output` value (`no`, `deps` or
    `full`) based on what ordering you require.
  - In the build event stream,
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_loaded is no longer populated.
    Its value was always mostly meaningless.
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_configured and
    BuildMetrics.ActionSummary.actions_created now include configured
    aspect data.
  - //visibility:legacy_public has been removed.
  - Flip and remove incompatible_dont_collect_so_artifacts
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13043).
  - Remove flag --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink: it is
    always true.
  - The Starlark method generate_dsym in objc fragment has
    been deleted.  Please use the equivalent apple_generate_dsym in
    cpp
    fragment instead.
  - Native libraries in data attribute are not collected. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13550 for details
  - Enforce the `--profile` path to be absolute.
  - Enforce the --memory_profile path to be absolute.
  - JavaToolchainInfo.jvm_opt returns Depset instead of a list.
  - --apple_sdk has been deleted.  It is a no-op.
  - --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build is now a no-op and will
    be deleted in a future release. Use --memory_profile=/dev/null
    instead.
  - Flipped --incompatible_disallow_resource_jars (see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13221).
  - Remove --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build
  - JSON trace profile: rename counter names.
  - Removed --action_graph from the dump command.
  - Remove `--{experimental_,}json_trace_compression` option.
  - Remove `--experimental_profile_cpu_usage`.
  - flipped --incompatible_java_common_parameters (see #12373)
  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since the path would refer to a
    netrc file inside the external repository by absolute path.
    Migration should be straightforward.
  - genrule switched to use exec transition instead of host. This can
    break targets with hardcoded output paths. To avoid using
    hardcoded paths use make variables, see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.2.2/be/make-variables.html#pre
    defined_label_variables
  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since...
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - The --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13907 for
    migration notes.
  - Split up the C++ archive from the C++ link action and set
    `CppArchive` as mnemonic.
  - workspace(managed_directories=) is not available anymore.
  - --legacy_important_outputs now has a default of false.
  - --legacy_important_outputs default reverted to true.
  - objc_library now requires CcInfo in its deps.  If this breaks
    you, add empty CcInfo() to your rule.
  - Flag --experimental_local_memory_estimate removed.
  - Added a new flag
    --incompatible_unambiguous_label_stringification, which causes
    labels in the main repo to stringify into unambiguous forms
    starting with an @. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15916 for more
    information.
  - analysis_test moved into testing.analysis_test
  - Flip incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)
  - (Rollback) Flip incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7260)
  - name parameter is removed from rule call
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16301)
  - name parameter is removed from rule call
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16301)
  - name parameter is removed from rule call
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16301)
  - --incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers is flipped to
    true. See #16356 for details.
  - GrpcRemoteDownloader only includes relevant headers instead of
    sending all credentials.
  - In package_group's `packages` attribute, the syntax "//..." now
    refers to all packages in the same repository as the package
    group, rather than all packages everywhere. The new item "public"
    can be used instead to obtain the old behavior. In `bazel query
    --output=proto` (and `--output=xml`), the `packages` attribute
    now serializes with the leading double slash included (for
    instance, `//foo/bar/...` instead of `foo/bar/...`). See also
    #16355, #16323, and #16391.
  - This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful
    builds from
    ```
    FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully (0 packages loaded)
    ```
    to
    ```
    ERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully
    ```
  - Bazel no longer increases the delay between progress updates when
    there is no cursor control.
  - This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful
    builds from
    ```
    FAILED: Build did NOT complete successfully (0 packages loaded)
    ```
    to
    ```
    ERROR: Build did NOT complete successfully
    ```
  - the --experimental_async_execution flag is now a no-op.
  - --experimental_replay_action_out_err is not a no-op.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped to true.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - When multiple --deleted_packages options are passed on the
    command line, they will be concatenated instead of the latest one
    taking effect.
  - This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful
    builds from
  - JSON profile: Use doubles instead of strings for counter series.
  - query --output=proto --order_output=deps now returns targets in
    topological order (previously there was no ordering).
  - --experimental_build_transitive_python_runfiles is flipped to
    false. See #16303 for details
  - --incompatible_python_disable_py2 is flipped to true. See #17293
    for details.
  - When remote cache evicts blobs, Bazel will exit with code 39.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - Bazel's local CPU resource on Linux is now container aware. Use
    `--local_cpu_resources`, `--loading_phase_threads` or `--jobs` to
    override.
  - `copy_from_rule` is exec_groups is deprecated
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17668).
  - --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op
  - --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op
  - --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op
  - `--experimental_execution_graph_log` no longer exists. Current
    users that want local logs need to pass
    `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log
    --experimental_execution_graph_log_path=/some/local/path`.
    Current users that want logs uploaded to BEP need to pass
    `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads`.
  - Remove 'darwin' as a CPU value, use 'darwin_x86_64' instead
  - Remove high priority workers functionality from blaze.

New features:

  - Args.add_all and Args.add_joined can now accept closures in
    map_each if explicitly enabled via allow_closure.
  - Add `--bes_header` flag to pass extra headers to the BES server.
  - Support local_repository in Bazel Registry's source.json file
  - The `aquery` and `cquery` commands now respect the
    `--query_file` flag just like the `query` command.

Important changes:

  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - none
    PAIR=cmita
  - The --incompatible_load_python_rules_from_bzl flag is now a no-op.
  - Filter all (instead of just C++) source files for coverage output
    according to --instrumentation_filter and
    --instrument_test_targets.
  - The `--incompatible_disable_native_apple_binary_rule` flag has
    been added which disables the native `apple_binary` rule. Users
    who need to use `apple_binary` directly (if they cannot use one
    of the more specific Apple rules) should load it from
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple.
  - The Android rules' --use_singlejar_apkbuilder is now a no-op.
    SingleJar will always be used to build APKs.
  - dict.setdefault(key, ...) now fails if dict is frozen, even if it
    already contains key. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info is removed.
     See #11359.
  - Starlark now permits def statements to be nested (closures).
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change,
    though the fallout is expected to be small.
  - Starlark now supports lambda (anonymous function) expressions.
  - The "test" and "coverage" commands no longer return 3 when a
    test action fails because of a system error. Instead, the exit
    code
    reflects the type of system error.
  - The undocumented ctx.expand feature no longer exists.
  - Make --legacy_dynamic_scheduler a no-op flag.
  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - native.existing_rule now returns a mutable list, not a tuple, for
    a list-valued attributes. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Roll back change to have native.existing_rules use list instead
    of tuple.
  - BEP includes test suite expansions.
  - config_setting now honors `visibility` attribute (and defaults to
    `//visibility:public`)
  - Change the MultiArchSplitTransitionProvider to be based on
    platform type + CPU instead of fixed "ios_" + cpu.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - add a flag to build v4 signature file
  - Added _direct_source_jars output group to Java related targets.
    END_PUBLIC
  - pkg_deb is no longer part of @bazel_tools//build_defs/pkg:pkg.bzl.
    Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/tree/main/pkg instead
  - Allowing the lipo operations to be conditional in the
    linkMultiArchBinary API for Apple binaries. Single architecture
    slices are now returned through AppleBinaryOutput and the
    Starlark API.
  - Release restriction for "-" in the package name for Python
    sources. Now `py_binary` and `py_test` targets can have main
    source file with "-" in the path.
  - Users consuming BEP may assume that a `named_set_of_files` event
    will
    appear before any event referencing that `named_set` by ID. This
    allows consumers
    to process the files for such events (eg. `TargetCompleted`)
    immediately.
  - BEP includes all files from successful actions in requested
    output groups.
    Previously, an output group's files were excluded if any file in
    the output group
    was not produced due to a failing action. Users can expect BEP
    output to be larger
    for failed builds.
  - In BEP, TargetComplete.output_group has a new field `incomplete`
    indicating that the file_sets field is missing one or more
    declared artifacts
    whose generating actions failed.
  - The flag `--toolchain_resolution_debug` now takes a regex
    argument, which is used to check which toolchain types should
    have debug info printed. You may use `.*` as an argument to keep
    the current behavior of debugging every toolchain type.
  - Add runfiles.merge_all() for merging a sequence of runfiles
    objects.
  - runfiles.merge() and merge_all() now respect
    --nested_set_depth_limit.
    If you hit the depth limit because you were calling merge() in a
    loop, use
    merge_all() on a sequence of runfiles objects instead.
  - Bazel will no longer create a bazel-out symlink if
    --symlink_prefix is specified: the directory pointed to via the
    bazel-out symlink is accessible via ${symlink_prefix}-out. If
    this causes problems for you, set
    --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink=false in your builds
    and file an issue.
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - Simplify build failure output by always using `NNN arguments`.
  - trim_test_configuration now defaults to on
  - Mark genrule.srcs as a source attribute for coverage.
  - When using --allow_analysis_failures (for example, via
    bazel-skylib's
    analysistest with `expect_failure = True`), analysis-time
    failures in aspect
    implementation functions will now be propagated and saved in
    AnalysisFailureInfo, just like analysis-time failures in rules.
  - cquery --noimplicit_deps now correctly filters out resolved
    cc_toolchains
  - Sign apks deterministically.
  - Make gcov optional in cc_toolchain tools.
  - If --experimental_prefer_mutual_xcode is passed, Bazel will
    choose the local default (instead of the newest mutually
    available version) if it's available both locally and remotely.
  - Remove java_lite_proto_library.strict_deps attribute.
  - Generate proguard configurations deterministically.
  - Adds a new flag, `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` which
    switches from the use of build variables to the feature of the
    same name.
  - Dropped fragile xz support from built in pkg_tar. Users requiring
    xz
    compression should switch to bazlebuild/rules_pkg.
  - If all strategies of one branch (the local or remote execution
    branch) of the `dynamic` strategy fail to even accept (via the
    response they give from `canExec`) the action, `dynamic` will now
    try to see if the other branch can accept it. (Trying to run it
    and it failing will still cause a failure if it was the first
    result, this is about strategies claiming they can't even try the
    action)
  - Add `disable_annotation_processing` option to
    `java_common.compile`, which disables any annotation processors
    passed to `plugins` or in `exported_plugins` of `deps`
  - Remove obsolete --incompatible_prohibit_aapt1
  - The minimum Android build tools version for the Android rules is
    now 30.0.0
  - Adds --experimental_reuse_sandbox_directories flag to reuse
    already-created non-worker sandboxes with cleanup.
  - --experimental_force_gc_after_build is deprecated and will be
    removed soon. Use --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build instead
  - Forward coverage-instrumented files from non-tool dependencies by
    default.
  - The used_heap_size_post_build field in BEP is populated when the
    --memory_profile flag is set
  - --run_validations defaults to true.
  - Consider label_keyed_string_dict attributes when gathering
    instrumented files for coverage.
  - Remove flag
    --experimental_forward_instrumented_files_info_by_default, now
    that this behavior is the default.
  - When using MemoryProfiler with multiple GCs via the
    --memory_profile_stable_heap_parameters flag, we do a more
    precise calculation of heap used at the end of the build. This
    will generally result in lower values.
  - --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build is deprecated. Use
    --memory_profile=/dev/null instead.
  - Disable --all_incompatible_changes flag.
  - The --all_incompatible_changes flag is now a no-op
  - The `--toolchain_resolution_debug` flag now accepts regexes
    matching targets, as well as toolchain types, when choosing what
    debug messages to print.
  - Adds --experimental_existing_rules_immutable_view flag to make the
    native.existing_rule and native.existing_rules functions more
    efficient by
    returning immutable, lightweight dict-like view objects instead
    of mutable
    dicts.
  - Add support to length-delimited protos as undeclared output
    annotations []
  - The deprecated "relative_to_caller_repository" parameter has been
    removed from the Label constructor.
  - The toolchain transition is now enabled for all toolchains.
  - incompatible_disable_depset_items is flipped
  - The --experimental_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    renamed to  --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view
  - Bazel no longer supports Java 8. From this version on, the
    minimum required JDK is OpenJDK 11.
  - Deprecate --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag, in preparation
    for removal in Bazel 6.x.
  - Treat py_*.srcs_version="PY2" the same as "PY2ONLY".
  - The Build Event Protocol now contains file digests and sizes
    along with the file name and URI.
  - Refactor system suspend event handling.
  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
  - Allow \a \b \f \v escape sequences in Starlark.
  - Match remote and local xcode version by most granular version.
  - Adds `--experimental_worker_multiplex_sandboxing` flag that
    controls whether to sandbox multiplex workers that support it.
  - provider() has a new parameter: init, a callback for performing
    pre-processing and validation of field values. Iff this parameter
    is set,
    provider() returns a tuple of 2 elements: the usual provider
    symbol (which,
    when called, invokes init) and a raw constructor (which bypasses
    init).
  - Tests that fail to create or complete their
    `TestAttemptContinuation` by
    throwing an `ExecException` will report an `INCOMPLETE` status.
    Previously, Bazel
    would fail to report any status for the test attempt.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Include more information about configurations in cquery proto
    formatted output. This deprecates the configuration field of
    AnalysisProtosV2.ConfiguredTarget, and adds a new field,
    configuration_id, to
    be used instead.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - In aquery and cquery proto output, indicate if a configuration is
    a
    tool or non-tool configuration.
  - Include complete configurations in cquery proto output.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add some documentation about how configuration information is
    conveyed in cquery proto output.
  - Introduces experimental static library linking API under
    apple_common.link_multi_arch_static_library
  - Further deprecation and removal of pkg_tar. Stop supporting
    legacy use of 'files' attribute, where it could be a list of
    labels instead of a map of paths to labels.
  - Removed --incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg flag. It never fulfilled
    its purpose because --all_incompatible_changes would never set
    it. The last rule it gated (pkg_tar) is scheduled to be removed
    in Bazel 6.x.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - The default dexer is now d8. dx can be optionally enabled using:
      --define=android_dexmerger_tool=dx_dexmerger \
      --define=android_incremental_dexing_tool=dx_dexbuilder \
      --define=android_standalone_dexing_tool=dx_compat_dx \
      --use_workers_with_dexbuilder
  - Packaging support for deploy JAR embedded JDK files (hermetic
    Java).
  - Don't stamp cc_common.link actions for tool dependencies.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Allow specialization to work with constraint_values.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - Make ijar / java_import preserve classes with `@kotlin.Metadata`
    annotations
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Add devtools/build/lib/worker:work_request_handlers to the remote
    android tools release package. This will be transitively packaged
    into all_android_tools.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - Advance android_tools_pkg version to 0.24.0.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - "blaze config" now only reports info from the last build. To
    compare configurations across multiple builds, redirect "blaze
    config" output to a file and run your favorite diff tool.
  - The --incompatible_override_toolchain_transition flag is now
    always set, and will be removed in the future. Thus,
    --noincompatible_override_toolchain_transition has no effect, and
    the value of the incompatible_use_toolchain_transition parameter
    in aspect() and rule() builtins is ignored.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Toolchain types may now be optional, in addition to mandatory.
    See https://bazel.build/docs/toolchains#optional-toolchains for
    further details.
  - Add six to deps of has_services=1 py_proto_librarys.
  - pkg_tar(symlinks) has been removed. Users needing that feature
    should
    migrate to @rules_pkg.
  - Aspects can now define and use exec groups using the same API as
    rules.
  - Removed the obsolete --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag. The
    feature is permanently enabled.
  - embedded_tools packages R8 desugarer again
  - Bazel now selects sh path based on execution platform instead of
    host platform, making it possible to execute sh actions in
    multiplatform builds. --shell_executable now only applies to
    actions configured for host.
  - labels in genquery.scope are no longer configured.
  - When Bzlmod is enabled, all Bzlmod-generated repos will have an
    extra '@' prepended to their names. This effectively enables the
    canonical label literal syntax for Bzlmod-generated repos
    (`@@canonicalRepoName//pkg:target`; see
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N81qfCa8oskCk5LqTW-LNthy6EBrDo
    t7bdUsjz6JFC4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Exposed `CcSharedLibraryInfo` to Starlark builtins.
  - Enable --use_top_level_targets_for_symlinks by default.
  - Singlejar accepts runtime Created-By field
  - --noincompatible_disable_managed_directories, and with that,
    workspace(managed_directories=) is not supported anymore.
  - Bazel supports D8 desugaring, albeit without persistent workers
  - Remove mtime options from pkg_tar. Users should migrate to
    @rules_pkg.
  - Test for experimental multiplexed persistent resource processor.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - The legacy pkg_tar no longer supports the ability to untar and
    repackage an input tar file (`deps` attribute). Users needed that
    capability must switch to github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
  - Change singlejar metadata to report Created-By Bazel
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
  - Revert interface_deps back to implementation_deps after problem
    reported in. Use `buildozer 'rename deps implementation_deps'
    //...:%cc_library; buildozer 'rename interface_deps deps'
    //...:%cc_library`
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.
  - D8 is the default desugarer
  - Migrate main_dex_list_creator to D8 (DX deprecation)
  - --experimental_enable_bzlmod has been renamed --enable_bzlmod,
    and still defaults to false.
  - selects() no longer produce irrelevant duplicate label checks
  - Adds a dexer output cache to CompatDexBuilder to improve build
    speed.
  - Improved error messages when analyzing inline bzl code
  - Improved error messages when analyzing inline bzl code
  - The `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler` flag now has the value
    `gcc` if the configured compiler is detected to be gcc rather
    than the generic value `compiler`. A branch for `gcc` may have to
    be added to `select` statements that do not have a default case
    that handles gcc appropriately.
  - The `get_child` method of `path` now accepts an arbitrary
    number of relative path strings as positional arguments.
  - SourceManifestAction supports `Action.content`
  - Add --incompatible_build_transitive_python_runfiles alias. See
    #16303
  - The @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler flag now has the value
    `clang` for the auto-configured Xcode toolchain rather than the
    generic value compiler. A branch for `clang` may have to be added
    to select statements that do not have a default case that handles
    this toolchain appropriately.
  - added additional debug message to warn of skipped toolchains
    during resolution
  - The deprecated --remote_allow_symlink_upload flag has been
    removed. Symlinks in local action outputs are always permitted,
    even with remote caching. Whether they're uploaded as symlinks or
    as the files/directories they point to is still determined by the
    --incompatible_remote_symlinks flag.
  - Added `struct`, `json`, `proto`, and `depset` to the starlark
    environment of Bazel's cquery (--output=starlark) command
  - Added three `package_group`-related flags:
    `--incompatible_package_group_includes_double_slash` (#16391),
    `--incompatible_package_group_has_public_syntax` (#16355), and
    `--incompatible_fix_package_group_reporoot_syntax` (#16323). With
    these flags, `package_group` can now easily specify "all
    packages", "no packages", and "all packages in the current repo".
  - Record hermetic packaged JDK modules file size in deploy JAR
    manifest 'JDK-Lib-Modules-Size' attribute.
  - .bzl files may now set a visibility to guard what other .bzl and
    BUILD files may load them. See [...] for more information.
  - Deletes the --extra_proguard_specs Blaze flag
  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - removed outdated ctx.host_fragments
  - removed outdated ctx.host_configuration
  - Now that the host configuration is finished, `genrule` should
    prefer the use of `tools` and stop using `exec_tools`.
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.
  - Update Android manifest merger to v30.1.3, and also drop support
    for legacy (pre-D8) desugaring.
  - Adds coverage metric support to android_local_test
  - Correctly encode double value positive infinity as "inf" instead
    of "+inf" for textprotos.
  - Add --use_target_platform_for_tests which uses the target
    platform for executing tests instead of the execution platform.
  - Custom C++ rules on Windows calling
    cc_common.create_linking_context_from_compilation_outputs should
    review whether each target of the rule type should produce a
    dynamic library since a condition which blocked their creation
    has been moved to the rules from behind the API.
  - Add flag `--experimental_remote_cache_ttl` and set the default
    value to 3 hours.
  - making --incompatible_use_platforms_repo_for_constraints do
    nothing. Using constraints from @bazel_tools//platforms with or
    without the flag will throw error with message "Constraints from
    @bazel_tools//platforms have been removed. Please use constraints
    from @platforms repository embedded in Bazel, or preferably
    declare dependency on https://github.com/bazelbuild/platforms"
  - Fixed an issue where WORKSPACE and WORKSPACE-loaded .bzl files
    couldn't see the Bzlmod root module's mappings when Bzlmod is
    enabled.
  - Subsequent settings of --extra_execution_platforms now override
    previous settings, instead of adding them to a list. If you
    currently set --extra_execution_platforms more than once, please
    migrate by passing a list of values to
    --extra_execution_platforms instead so that earlier values aren't
    overwritten.
  - @bazel_tools//config:common_settings.bzl has been removed.
    Use @bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl instead.
  - cc_shared_library is no longer experimental, see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16709 for details
  - The flag `--distinct_host_configuration` is removed. It has been
    a no-op since Bazel 6.0.0.
  - Added `native.module_name()` and `native.module_version()` to
    allow BUILD macro authors to acquire information about which
    Bazel module the current repo is associated with.
  - Add `--skip_incompatible_explicit_targets` option
  - Remove 'darwin' as a CPU value, use 'darwin_x86_64' instead
  - cc_test can now be configured by using a native.toolchain().
  - `@foo` labels can now be used on the command line as the
    top-level target (that is, `bazel build @foo` now works).
    Double-dot syntax is now forbidden (`bazel build ../foo` will no
    longer work).
  - The location of rules that explicitly specify `generator_name`
    and/or `generator_function` attributes (typically because they
    are incidentally copied from `native.existing_rule()`) is now the
    top-level call in the `BUILD` file, which is consistent with
    rules that do not explicitly specify these attributes.
  - Warnings (most notably those associated with the `deprecation`
    rule attribute) are no longer replayed on subsequent invocations
    unless the target in question is re-analyzed. Warnings are purely
    informational, so this change has no bearing on the correctness
    of the build. Downstream tests that break due to this change
    should update their expectations.
  - `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload` has been renamed to
    `--remote_build_event_upload`
  - [Breaking change] platform, constraint_setting, and
    constraint_value can no longer take an applicable_licenses value.
    Remediation is to remove the attribute and rely on the package
    level default.
  - `--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata` has been
    renamed to `--action_cache_store_output_metadata`
  - Changed the default value for `--remote_build_event_upload` to
    `minimal`.
  - `--experimental_remote_cache_compression` has been renamed to
    `--remote_cache_compression`
  - The REPO.bazel and MODULE.bazel files are now also considered
    workspace boundary markers.

## Release 4.2.4 (2023-04-20)

```
Baseline: 37a429ad12b4c9e6a62dbae4881a1ff03b81ab40

Cherry picks:

   + a689d673abadf80f1efaf8ddaeee92d56fc2847b:
     Use getRunfilesPath for run_under executable path generation.
     getRootRelativePath doesn't return a valid runfiles path for
     external source files anymore after the recent external source
     root change. Also, it won't work for external labels either once
     the --nolegacy_external_runfiles becomes default. This fixes
     issue #12545.
   + d90ec67fdab9710f649a3c1d374fb6b938b9271a:
     Fix NPE when coveragerunner is not set on the toolchain.
   + 8555789dd239a5ac229c1d9cee80b2a9f30b3bf7:

   + 07400c0392e7be163f8a3396fa5cf89ce6705412:
     Add --{no,}autodetect_server_javabase.
   + c83366064621d5a265eba14d93a03deff58fe6d8:
     Only treat "env" and "env_inherit" attrs specially for native
     rules
   + 6a60b30cd0f22d0ab84b2ddd658d5ccb899a8a76:

```

Incompatible changes:

  - GrpcRemoteDownloader only includes relevant headers instead of
    sending all credentials.
    
    Closes #16439.

Important changes:

  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - The minimum Android build tools version for the Android rules is
    now 30.0.0
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - If all strategies of one branch (the local or remote execution
    branch) of the `dynamic` strategy fail to even accept (via the
    response they give from `canExec`) the action, `dynamic` will now
    try to see if the other branch can accept it. (Trying to run it
    and it failing will still cause a failure if it was the first
    result, this is about strategies claiming they can't even try the
    action)

Incompatible changes:

  - GrpcRemoteDownloader only includes relevant headers instead of
    sending all credentials.
    
    Closes #16439.
  - analysis_test moved into testing.analysis_test

Important changes:

  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13047.
    
    Closes #14310.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
    
    Closes #14971.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
    
    Closes #14849.
  - none
    RELNOTES:none
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
    
    Progress on https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15856
    
    Closes #15947.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
    
    Closes #15552.
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.
  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
    
    Work towards #16124
    Fixes #10923
    
    Closes #16667.

    there is no cursor control.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped
    to true. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for
    details.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
    
    Closes #16602.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13839
    
    Closes #16626.

Important changes:

  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
    
    Work towards #16124
    Fixes #10923
    
    Closes #16428.
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.

## Release 7.0.0-pre.20230410.1 (2023-04-17)

```
Baseline: 237fb69ede58a7cb672363451c2cb455637fccfe
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Remove high priority workers functionality from blaze.

Important changes:

  - `--experimental_remote_build_event_upload` has been renamed to
    `--remote_build_event_upload`
  - [Breaking change] platform, constraint_setting, and
    constraint_value can no longer take an applicable_licenses value.
    Remediation is to remove the attribute and rely on the package
    level default.

## Release 7.0.0-pre.20230405.2 (2023-04-12)

```
Baseline: 177f0d49913d74e7b1a4aae52f835702d7e85401

Cherry picks:

   + 81ee0fc29fb538d0849c6e7ccfff925f99b87453:
     Remove globDeps containing some Glob skyKey check
```

Important changes:

  - cc_test can now be configured by using a native.toolchain().
  - `@foo` labels can now be used on the command line as the
    top-level target (that is, `bazel build @foo` now works).
    Double-dot syntax is now forbidden (`bazel build ../foo` will no
    longer work).
  - The location of rules that explicitly specify `generator_name`
    and/or `generator_function` attributes (typically because they
    are incidentally copied from `native.existing_rule()`) is now the
    top-level call in the `BUILD` file, which is consistent with
    rules that do not explicitly specify these attributes.
  - Warnings (most notably those associated with the `deprecation`
    rule attribute) are no longer replayed on subsequent invocations
    unless the target in question is re-analyzed. Warnings are purely
    informational, so this change has no bearing on the correctness
    of the build. Downstream tests that break due to this change
    should update their expectations.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - `--experimental_execution_graph_log` no longer exists. Current
    users that want local logs need to pass
    `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log
    --experimental_execution_graph_log_path=/some/local/path`.
    Current users that want logs uploaded to BEP need to pass
    `--experimental_enable_execution_graph_log
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads`.
  - Remove 'darwin' as a CPU value, use 'darwin_x86_64' instead

Important changes:

  - Added `native.module_name()` and `native.module_version()` to
    allow BUILD macro authors to acquire information about which
    Bazel module the current repo is associated with.
  - Add `--skip_incompatible_explicit_targets` option
  - Remove 'darwin' as a CPU value, use 'darwin_x86_64' instead

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel's local CPU resource on Linux is now container aware. Use
    `--local_cpu_resources`, `--loading_phase_threads` or `--jobs` to
    override.
  - `copy_from_rule` is exec_groups is deprecated
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17668).
  - --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op
  - --legacy_bazel_java_test is now a no-op

Important changes:

  - making --incompatible_use_platforms_repo_for_constraints do
    nothing. Using constraints from @bazel_tools//platforms with or
    without the flag will throw error with message "Constraints from
    @bazel_tools//platforms have been removed. Please use constraints
    from @platforms repository embedded in Bazel, or preferably
    declare dependency on https://github.com/bazelbuild/platforms"
  - Fixed an issue where WORKSPACE and WORKSPACE-loaded .bzl files
    couldn't see the Bzlmod root module's mappings when Bzlmod is
    enabled.
  - Subsequent settings of --extra_execution_platforms now override
    previous settings, instead of adding them to a list. If you
    currently set --extra_execution_platforms more than once, please
    migrate by passing a list of values to
    --extra_execution_platforms instead so that earlier values aren't
    overwritten.
  - @bazel_tools//config:common_settings.bzl has been removed.
    Use @bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl instead.
  - cc_shared_library is no longer experimental, see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16709 for details

  - the --experimental_async_execution flag is now a no-op.
  - --experimental_replay_action_out_err is not a no-op.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped to true.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - When multiple --deleted_packages options are passed on the
    command line, they will be concatenated instead of the latest one
    taking effect.
  - This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful
    builds from
  - JSON profile: Use doubles instead of strings for counter series.
  - query --output=proto --order_output=deps now returns targets in
    topological order (previously there was no ordering).
  - --experimental_build_transitive_python_runfiles is flipped to
    false. See #16303 for details
  - --incompatible_python_disable_py2 is flipped to true. See #17293
    for details.
  - When remote cache evicts blobs, Bazel will exit with code 39.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.

New features:

  - The `aquery` and `cquery` commands now respect the
    `--query_file` flag just like the `query` command.

Important changes:

  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - removed outdated ctx.host_fragments
  - removed outdated ctx.host_configuration
  - Now that the host configuration is finished, `genrule` should
    prefer the use of `tools` and stop using `exec_tools`.
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.
  - Update Android manifest merger to v30.1.3, and also drop support
    for legacy (pre-D8) desugaring.
  - Adds coverage metric support to android_local_test
  - Correctly encode double value positive infinity as "inf" instead
    of "+inf" for textprotos.
  - Add --use_target_platform_for_tests which uses the target
    platform for executing tests instead of the execution platform.
  - Custom C++ rules on Windows calling
    cc_common.create_linking_context_from_compilation_outputs should
    review whether each target of the rule type should produce a
    dynamic library since a condition which blocked their creation
    has been moved to the rules from behind the API.
  - Add flag `--experimental_remote_cache_ttl` and set the default
    value to 3 hours.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel no longer increases the delay between progress updates when
    there is no cursor control.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped
    to true. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for
    details.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
    
    Closes #16602.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13839
    
    Closes #16626.

Important changes:

  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
    
    Work towards #16124
    Fixes #10923
    
    Closes #16428.
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.

This release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Brentley Jones, Ezekiel Warren, Fabian Meumertzheim, keertk, Keith Smiley, Krzysztof Naglik, kshyanashree, lunch-glide-pepper, oquenchil, Ted Kaplan, Ted Kaplan, UebelAndre, Xùdōng Yáng, Yannic, yuzhy8701.

  - the --experimental_async_execution flag is now a no-op.
  - --experimental_replay_action_out_err is not a no-op.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See

    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - When multiple --deleted_packages options are passed on the
    command line, they will be concatenated instead of the latest one
    taking effect.
  - This has the side effect of changing the message on unsuccessful
    builds from
  - JSON profile: Use doubles instead of strings for counter series.
  - query --output=proto --order_output=deps now returns targets in
    topological order (previously there was no ordering).
  - --experimental_build_transitive_python_runfiles is flipped to
    false. See #16303 for details
  - --incompatible_python_disable_py2 is flipped to true. See #17293
    for details.
  - When remote cache evicts blobs, Bazel will exit with code 39.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)

New features:

  - The `aquery` and `cquery` commands now respect the
    `--query_file` flag just like the `query` command.

Important changes:

  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of

    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - removed outdated ctx.host_fragments
  - removed outdated ctx.host_configuration
  - Now that the host configuration is finished, `genrule` should
    prefer the use of `tools` and stop using `exec_tools`.
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.
  - Update Android manifest merger to v30.1.3, and also drop support
    for legacy (pre-D8) desugaring.
  - Adds coverage metric support to android_local_test
  - Correctly encode double value positive infinity as "inf" instead
    of "+inf" for textprotos.
  - Add --use_target_platform_for_tests which uses the target
    platform for executing tests instead of the execution platform.
  - Custom C++ rules on Windows calling
    cc_common.create_linking_context_from_compilation_outputs should
    review whether each target of the rule type should produce a
    dynamic library since a condition which blocked their creation
    has been moved to the rules from behind the API.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel no longer increases the delay between progress updates when
    there is no cursor control.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped
    to true. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for
    details.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
    
    Closes #16602.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13839
    
    Closes #16626.

Important changes:

  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
    
    Work towards #16124
    Fixes #10923
    
    Closes #16428.
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel no longer increases the delay between progress updates when
    there is no cursor control.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped
    to true. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for
    details.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
    
    Closes #16602.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.
  - `--features` only applies to targets built in the target
    configuration, and `--host_features` is used for the host / exec
    configuration (gated behind `--incompatible_use_host_features`)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13839
    
    Closes #16626.

Important changes:

  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
    
    Work towards #16124
    Fixes #10923
    
    Closes #16428.
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test
  - Added a `native.package_relative_label()` function, which
    converts a label string to a Label object in the context of the
    calling package, in contrast to `Label()`, which does so in the
    context of the current .bzl file. Both functions now also accept
    relative labels such as `:foo`, and are idempotent.

Incompatible changes:

  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since the path would refer to a
    netrc file inside the external repository by absolute path.
    Migration should be straightforward.
  - genrule switched to use exec transition instead of host. This can
    break targets with hardcoded output paths. To avoid using
    hardcoded paths use make variables, see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.2.2/be/make-variables.html#pre
    defined_label_variables
  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since...
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - The --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13907 for
    migration notes.
  - Split up the C++ archive from the C++ link action and set
    `CppArchive` as mnemonic.
  - workspace(managed_directories=) is not available anymore.
  - --legacy_important_outputs now has a default of false.
  - --legacy_important_outputs default reverted to true.
  - objc_library now requires CcInfo in its deps.  If this breaks
    you, add empty CcInfo() to your rule.
  - Flag --experimental_local_memory_estimate removed.
  - Added a new flag
    --incompatible_unambiguous_label_stringification, which causes
    labels in the main repo to stringify into unambiguous forms
    starting with an @. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15916 for more
    information.

  - name parameter is removed from rule call
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16301)
  - --incompatible_remote_downloader_send_all_headers is flipped to
    true. See #16356 for details.
  - GrpcRemoteDownloader only includes relevant headers instead of
    sending all credentials.
  - In package_group's `packages` attribute, the syntax "//..." now
    refers to all packages in the same repository as the package
    group, rather than all packages everywhere. The new item "public"
    can be used instead to obtain the old behavior. In `bazel query
    --output=proto` (and `--output=xml`), the `packages` attribute
    now serializes with the leading double slash included (for
    instance, `//foo/bar/...` instead of `foo/bar/...`). See also
    #16355, #16323, and #16391.
  - Bazel no longer increases the delay between progress updates when
    there is no cursor control.
  - `--incompatible_always_include_files_in_data` is flipped
    to true. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16654 for
    details.
  - `cquery --output=files` also outputs source files.
    
    Closes #16602.
  - `--incompatible_strict_conflict_checks` is flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16729 for details.
  - This changes the behavior of Python version in exec/host
    configuration. Mitigation is to set Python version on the targets.

New features:

  - Support local_repository in Bazel Registry's source.json file

Important changes:

  - Deprecate --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag, in preparation
    for removal in Bazel 6.x.
  - Treat py_*.srcs_version="PY2" the same as "PY2ONLY".
  - The Build Event Protocol now contains file digests and sizes
    along with the file name and URI.
  - Refactor system suspend event handling.
  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
  - Allow \a \b \f \v escape sequences in Starlark.
  - Match remote and local xcode version by most granular version.
  - Adds `--experimental_worker_multiplex_sandboxing` flag that
    controls whether to sandbox multiplex workers that support it.
  - provider() has a new parameter: init, a callback for performing
    pre-processing and validation of field values. Iff this parameter
    is set,
    provider() returns a tuple of 2 elements: the usual provider
    symbol (which,
    when called, invokes init) and a raw constructor (which bypasses
    init).
  - Tests that fail to create or complete their
    `TestAttemptContinuation` by
    throwing an `ExecException` will report an `INCOMPLETE` status.
    Previously, Bazel
    would fail to report any status for the test attempt.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Include more information about configurations in cquery proto
    formatted output. This deprecates the configuration field of
    AnalysisProtosV2.ConfiguredTarget, and adds a new field,
    configuration_id, to
    be used instead.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - In aquery and cquery proto output, indicate if a configuration is
    a
    tool or non-tool configuration.
  - Include complete configurations in cquery proto output.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add some documentation about how configuration information is
    conveyed in cquery proto output.
  - Introduces experimental static library linking API under
    apple_common.link_multi_arch_static_library
  - Further deprecation and removal of pkg_tar. Stop supporting
    legacy use of 'files' attribute, where it could be a list of
    labels instead of a map of paths to labels.
  - Removed --incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg flag. It never fulfilled
    its purpose because --all_incompatible_changes would never set
    it. The last rule it gated (pkg_tar) is scheduled to be removed
    in Bazel 6.x.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - The default dexer is now d8. dx can be optionally enabled using:
      --define=android_dexmerger_tool=dx_dexmerger \
      --define=android_incremental_dexing_tool=dx_dexbuilder \
      --define=android_standalone_dexing_tool=dx_compat_dx \
      --use_workers_with_dexbuilder
  - Packaging support for deploy JAR embedded JDK files (hermetic
    Java).
  - Don't stamp cc_common.link actions for tool dependencies.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Allow specialization to work with constraint_values.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - Make ijar / java_import preserve classes with `@kotlin.Metadata`
    annotations
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Add devtools/build/lib/worker:work_request_handlers to the remote
    android tools release package. This will be transitively packaged
    into all_android_tools.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - Advance android_tools_pkg version to 0.24.0.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - "blaze config" now only reports info from the last build. To
    compare configurations across multiple builds, redirect "blaze
    config" output to a file and run your favorite diff tool.
  - The --incompatible_override_toolchain_transition flag is now
    always set, and will be removed in the future. Thus,
    --noincompatible_override_toolchain_transition has no effect, and
    the value of the incompatible_use_toolchain_transition parameter
    in aspect() and rule() builtins is ignored.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Toolchain types may now be optional, in addition to mandatory.
    See https://bazel.build/docs/toolchains#optional-toolchains for
    further details.
  - Add six to deps of has_services=1 py_proto_librarys.
  - pkg_tar(symlinks) has been removed. Users needing that feature
    should
    migrate to @rules_pkg.
  - Aspects can now define and use exec groups using the same API as
    rules.
  - Removed the obsolete --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag. The
    feature is permanently enabled.
  - embedded_tools packages R8 desugarer again
  - Bazel now selects sh path based on execution platform instead of
    host platform, making it possible to execute sh actions in
    multiplatform builds. --shell_executable now only applies to
    actions configured for host.
  - labels in genquery.scope are no longer configured.
  - When Bzlmod is enabled, all Bzlmod-generated repos will have an
    extra '@' prepended to their names. This effectively enables the
    canonical label literal syntax for Bzlmod-generated repos
    (`@@canonicalRepoName//pkg:target`; see
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N81qfCa8oskCk5LqTW-LNthy6EBrDo
    t7bdUsjz6JFC4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Exposed `CcSharedLibraryInfo` to Starlark builtins.
  - Enable --use_top_level_targets_for_symlinks by default.
  - Singlejar accepts runtime Created-By field
  - --noincompatible_disable_managed_directories, and with that,
    workspace(managed_directories=) is not supported anymore.
  - Bazel supports D8 desugaring, albeit without persistent workers
  - Remove mtime options from pkg_tar. Users should migrate to
    @rules_pkg.
  - Test for experimental multiplexed persistent resource processor.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - The legacy pkg_tar no longer supports the ability to untar and
    repackage an input tar file (`deps` attribute). Users needed that
    capability must switch to github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
  - Change singlejar metadata to report Created-By Bazel
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
  - Revert interface_deps back to implementation_deps after problem
    reported in. Use `buildozer 'rename deps implementation_deps'
    //...:%cc_library; buildozer 'rename interface_deps deps'
    //...:%cc_library`
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.
  - D8 is the default desugarer
  - Migrate main_dex_list_creator to D8 (DX deprecation)
  - --experimental_enable_bzlmod has been renamed --enable_bzlmod,
    and still defaults to false.
  - selects() no longer produce irrelevant duplicate label checks
  - Adds a dexer output cache to CompatDexBuilder to improve build
    speed.
  - Improved error messages when analyzing inline bzl code
  - Improved error messages when analyzing inline bzl code
  - The `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler` flag now has the value
    `gcc` if the configured compiler is detected to be gcc rather
    than the generic value `compiler`. A branch for `gcc` may have to
    be added to `select` statements that do not have a default case
    that handles gcc appropriately.
  - The `get_child` method of `path` now accepts an arbitrary
    number of relative path strings as positional arguments.
  - SourceManifestAction supports `Action.content`
  - Add --incompatible_build_transitive_python_runfiles alias. See
    #16303
  - The @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler flag now has the value
    `clang` for the auto-configured Xcode toolchain rather than the
    generic value compiler. A branch for `clang` may have to be added
    to select statements that do not have a default case that handles
    this toolchain appropriately.
  - added additional debug message to warn of skipped toolchains
    during resolution
  - The deprecated --remote_allow_symlink_upload flag has been
    removed. Symlinks in local action outputs are always permitted,
    even with remote caching. Whether they're uploaded as symlinks or
    as the files/directories they point to is still determined by the
    --incompatible_remote_symlinks flag.
  - Added `struct`, `json`, `proto`, and `depset` to the starlark
    environment of Bazel's cquery (--output=starlark) command
  - Added three `package_group`-related flags:
    `--incompatible_package_group_includes_double_slash` (#16391),
    `--incompatible_package_group_has_public_syntax` (#16355), and
    `--incompatible_fix_package_group_reporoot_syntax` (#16323). With
    these flags, `package_group` can now easily specify "all
    packages", "no packages", and "all packages in the current repo".
  - Record hermetic packaged JDK modules file size in deploy JAR
    manifest 'JDK-Lib-Modules-Size' attribute.
  - .bzl files may now set a visibility to guard what other .bzl and
    BUILD files may load them. See [...] for more information.
  - Deletes the --extra_proguard_specs Blaze flag
  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).
    
    Work towards #16124
    Fixes #10923
    
    Closes #16428.
  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.
  - Fixes a bug where some compilation flags would not be applied to
    a cc_test

Important changes:

  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13047.
    
    Closes #14310.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
    
    Closes #14971.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.

    RELNOTES:none
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
    
    Progress on https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15856
    
    Closes #15947.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
    
    Closes #15552.
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.
  - The new path variable `$(rlocationpath ...)` and its plural form
    `$(rlocationpaths ...)` can be used to expand labels to the paths
    accepted by the `Rlocation` function of runfiles libraries. This
    is the preferred way to access data dependencies at runtime and
    works on all platforms, even when runfiles are not enabled (e.g.,
    on Windows by default).

     Add support for crosstool feature to prefer PIC compiles even
     for optimized binaries. This can have performance penalty, but
     in configurations where dynamic linking is used for tests can
     lead to a substantially better sharing of artifacts between
     tests and binaries. In contrast to the existing --force_pic,
     this can be enabled per crosstool and respects whether PIC is
     available for the used crosstool.
```

Incompatible changes:

  - --experimental_replay_action_out_err is not a no-op.

Incompatible changes:

  - the --experimental_async_execution flag is now a no-op.

New features:

  - The `aquery` and `cquery` commands now respect the
    `--query_file` flag just like the `query` command.

Important changes:

  - Starlark `print()` statements are now emitted iff the line of
    code is executed. They are no longer replayed on subsequent
    invocations unless the Starlark code is re-executed.
    Additionally, multiple identical `print()` statements (same
    string from the same line of code, e.g. from a loop) are all
    emitted and no longer deduplicated.

Incompatible changes:

  - In package_group's `packages` attribute, the syntax "//..." now
    refers to all packages in the same repository as the package
    group, rather than all packages everywhere. The new item "public"
    can be used instead to obtain the old behavior. In `bazel query
    --output=proto` (and `--output=xml`), the `packages` attribute
    now serializes with the leading double slash included (for
    instance, `//foo/bar/...` instead of `foo/bar/...`). See also
    #16355, #16323, and #16391.

New features:

  - Support local_repository in Bazel Registry's source.json file

Important changes:

  - Record hermetic packaged JDK modules file size in deploy JAR
    manifest 'JDK-Lib-Modules-Size' attribute.
  - .bzl files may now set a visibility to guard what other .bzl and
    BUILD files may load them. See [...] for more information.

Incompatible changes:

  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since the path would refer to a
    netrc file inside the external repository by absolute path.
    Migration should be straightforward.
  - genrule switched to use exec transition instead of host. This can
    break targets with hardcoded output paths. To avoid using
    hardcoded paths use make variables, see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.2.2/be/make-variables.html#pre
    defined_label_variables
  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there

  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using

  - The --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13907 for
    migration notes.
  - Split up the C++ archive from the C++ link action and set
    `CppArchive` as mnemonic.
  - workspace(managed_directories=) is not available anymore.
  - --legacy_important_outputs now has a default of false.
  - --legacy_important_outputs default reverted to true.
  - objc_library now requires CcInfo in its deps.  If this breaks
    you, add empty CcInfo() to your rule.
  - Flag --experimental_local_memory_estimate removed.
  - Added a new flag
    --incompatible_unambiguous_label_stringification, which causes
    labels in the main repo to stringify into unambiguous forms
    starting with an @. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15916 for more
    information.

Important changes:

  - Deprecate --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag, in preparation
    for removal in Bazel 6.x.
  - Treat py_*.srcs_version="PY2" the same as "PY2ONLY".
  - The Build Event Protocol now contains file digests and sizes
    along with the file name and URI.
  - Refactor system suspend event handling.
  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
  - Allow \a \b \f \v escape sequences in Starlark.
  - Match remote and local xcode version by most granular version.
  - Adds `--experimental_worker_multiplex_sandboxing` flag that
    controls whether to sandbox multiplex workers that support it.
  - provider() has a new parameter: init, a callback for performing
    pre-processing and validation of field values. Iff this parameter
    is set,
    provider() returns a tuple of 2 elements: the usual provider
    symbol (which,
    when called, invokes init) and a raw constructor (which bypasses
    init).
  - Tests that fail to create or complete their
    `TestAttemptContinuation` by
    throwing an `ExecException` will report an `INCOMPLETE` status.
    Previously, Bazel
    would fail to report any status for the test attempt.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Include more information about configurations in cquery proto
    formatted output. This deprecates the configuration field of
    AnalysisProtosV2.ConfiguredTarget, and adds a new field,
    configuration_id, to
    be used instead.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - In aquery and cquery proto output, indicate if a configuration is
    a
    tool or non-tool configuration.
  - Include complete configurations in cquery proto output.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add some documentation about how configuration information is
    conveyed in cquery proto output.
  - Introduces experimental static library linking API under
    apple_common.link_multi_arch_static_library
  - Further deprecation and removal of pkg_tar. Stop supporting
    legacy use of 'files' attribute, where it could be a list of
    labels instead of a map of paths to labels.
  - Removed --incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg flag. It never fulfilled
    its purpose because --all_incompatible_changes would never set
    it. The last rule it gated (pkg_tar) is scheduled to be removed
    in Bazel 6.x.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - The default dexer is now d8. dx can be optionally enabled using:
      --define=android_dexmerger_tool=dx_dexmerger \
      --define=android_incremental_dexing_tool=dx_dexbuilder \
      --define=android_standalone_dexing_tool=dx_compat_dx \
      --use_workers_with_dexbuilder
  - Packaging support for deploy JAR embedded JDK files (hermetic
    Java).
  - Don't stamp cc_common.link actions for tool dependencies.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Allow specialization to work with constraint_values.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - Make ijar / java_import preserve classes with `@kotlin.Metadata`
    annotations
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Add devtools/build/lib/worker:work_request_handlers to the remote
    android tools release package. This will be transitively packaged
    into all_android_tools.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - Advance android_tools_pkg version to 0.24.0.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - "blaze config" now only reports info from the last build. To
    compare configurations across multiple builds, redirect "blaze
    config" output to a file and run your favorite diff tool.
  - The --incompatible_override_toolchain_transition flag is now
    always set, and will be removed in the future. Thus,
    --noincompatible_override_toolchain_transition has no effect, and
    the value of the incompatible_use_toolchain_transition parameter
    in aspect() and rule() builtins is ignored.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Toolchain types may now be optional, in addition to mandatory.
    See https://bazel.build/docs/toolchains#optional-toolchains for
    further details.
  - Add six to deps of has_services=1 py_proto_librarys.
  - pkg_tar(symlinks) has been removed. Users needing that feature
    should
    migrate to @rules_pkg.
  - Aspects can now define and use exec groups using the same API as
    rules.
  - Removed the obsolete --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag. The
    feature is permanently enabled.
  - embedded_tools packages R8 desugarer again
  - Bazel now selects sh path based on execution platform instead of
    host platform, making it possible to execute sh actions in
    multiplatform builds. --shell_executable now only applies to
    actions configured for host.
  - labels in genquery.scope are no longer configured.
  - When Bzlmod is enabled, all Bzlmod-generated repos will have an
    extra '@' prepended to their names. This effectively enables the
    canonical label literal syntax for Bzlmod-generated repos
    (`@@canonicalRepoName//pkg:target`; see
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N81qfCa8oskCk5LqTW-LNthy6EBrDo
    t7bdUsjz6JFC4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Exposed `CcSharedLibraryInfo` to Starlark builtins.
  - Enable --use_top_level_targets_for_symlinks by default.
  - Singlejar accepts runtime Created-By field
  - --noincompatible_disable_managed_directories, and with that,
    workspace(managed_directories=) is not supported anymore.
  - Bazel supports D8 desugaring, albeit without persistent workers
  - Remove mtime options from pkg_tar. Users should migrate to
    @rules_pkg.
  - Test for experimental multiplexed persistent resource processor.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - The legacy pkg_tar no longer supports the ability to untar and
    repackage an input tar file (`deps` attribute). Users needed that
    capability must switch to github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
  - Change singlejar metadata to report Created-By Bazel
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
  - Revert interface_deps back to implementation_deps after problem
    reported in. Use `buildozer 'rename deps implementation_deps'
    //...:%cc_library; buildozer 'rename interface_deps deps'
    //...:%cc_library`
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.
  - D8 is the default desugarer
  - Migrate main_dex_list_creator to D8 (DX deprecation)
  - --experimental_enable_bzlmod has been renamed --enable_bzlmod,
    and still defaults to false.
  - selects() no longer produce irrelevant duplicate label checks
  - Adds a dexer output cache to CompatDexBuilder to improve build
    speed.
  - Improved error messages when analyzing inline bzl code
  - Improved error messages when analyzing inline bzl code
  - The `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler` flag now has the value
    `gcc` if the configured compiler is detected to be gcc rather
    than the generic value `compiler`. A branch for `gcc` may have to
    be added to `select` statements that do not have a default case
    that handles gcc appropriately.
  - The `get_child` method of `path` now accepts an arbitrary
    number of relative path strings as positional arguments.
  - SourceManifestAction supports `Action.content`
  - Add --incompatible_build_transitive_python_runfiles alias. See
    #16303
  - The @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler flag now has the value
    `clang` for the auto-configured Xcode toolchain rather than the
    generic value compiler. A branch for `clang` may have to be added
    to select statements that do not have a default case that handles
    this toolchain appropriately.
  - added additional debug message to warn of skipped toolchains
    during resolution
  - The deprecated --remote_allow_symlink_upload flag has been
    removed. Symlinks in local action outputs are always permitted,
    even with remote caching. Whether they're uploaded as symlinks or
    as the files/directories they point to is still determined by the
    --incompatible_remote_symlinks flag.
  - Added `struct`, `json`, `proto`, and `depset` to the starlark
    environment of Bazel's cquery (--output=starlark) command
  - Added three `package_group`-related flags:
    `--incompatible_package_group_includes_double_slash` (#16391),
    `--incompatible_package_group_has_public_syntax` (#16355), and
    `--incompatible_fix_package_group_reporoot_syntax` (#16323). With

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Removing java_common.javac_jar Starlark call.
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change
    because there is some code that relies on the precise type
    returned, including brittle workarounds for this bug specifically
    and insufficiently flexible workarounds for other issues with the
    intersection of select and native.existing_rule.
  - flipped incompatible_use_toolchain_resolution_for_java_rules, see
    #7849
  - Query output=xml/proto/location for source files will now show
    the location of line 1 of the source file (as the new default)
    instead of its location in the BUILD file.
  - Specifying a target pattern underneath a directory specified by
    .bazelignore will now emit a warning, not an error.
  - Query `--order_output=auto` will now sort lexicographically.
    However, when `somepath` is used as a top level function (e.g.
    `query 'somepath(a, b)'`), it will continue to output in
    dependency order. If you do not want the lexicographical output
    ordering, specify another `--order_output` value (`no`, `deps` or
    `full`) based on what ordering you require.
  - In the build event stream,
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_loaded is no longer populated.
    Its value was always mostly meaningless.
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_configured and
    BuildMetrics.ActionSummary.actions_created now include configured
    aspect data.
  - //visibility:legacy_public has been removed.
  - Flip and remove incompatible_dont_collect_so_artifacts
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13043).
  - Remove flag --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink: it is
    always true.
  - The Starlark method generate_dsym in objc fragment has
    been deleted.  Please use the equivalent apple_generate_dsym in
    cpp
    fragment instead.
  - Native libraries in data attribute are not collected. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13550 for details
  - Enforce the `--profile` path to be absolute.
  - Enforce the --memory_profile path to be absolute.
  - JavaToolchainInfo.jvm_opt returns Depset instead of a list.
  - --apple_sdk has been deleted.  It is a no-op.
  - --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build is now a no-op and will
    be deleted in a future release. Use --memory_profile=/dev/null
    instead.
  - Flipped --incompatible_disallow_resource_jars (see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13221).
  - Remove --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build
  - JSON trace profile: rename counter names.
  - Removed --action_graph from the dump command.
  - Remove `--{experimental_,}json_trace_compression` option.
  - Remove `--experimental_profile_cpu_usage`.
  - flipped --incompatible_java_common_parameters (see #12373)
  - GrpcRemoteDownloader only includes relevant headers instead of
    sending all credentials.
    
    Closes #16439.

New features:

  - Args.add_all and Args.add_joined can now accept closures in
    map_each if explicitly enabled via allow_closure.
  - Add `--bes_header` flag to pass extra headers to the BES server.

Important changes:

  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - none
    PAIR=cmita
  - The --incompatible_load_python_rules_from_bzl flag is now a no-op.
  - Filter all (instead of just C++) source files for coverage output
    according to --instrumentation_filter and
    --instrument_test_targets.
  - The `--incompatible_disable_native_apple_binary_rule` flag has
    been added which disables the native `apple_binary` rule. Users
    who need to use `apple_binary` directly (if they cannot use one
    of the more specific Apple rules) should load it from
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple.
  - The Android rules' --use_singlejar_apkbuilder is now a no-op.
    SingleJar will always be used to build APKs.
  - dict.setdefault(key, ...) now fails if dict is frozen, even if it
    already contains key. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info is removed.
     See #11359.
  - Starlark now permits def statements to be nested (closures).
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change,
    though the fallout is expected to be small.
  - Starlark now supports lambda (anonymous function) expressions.
  - The "test" and "coverage" commands no longer return 3 when a
    test action fails because of a system error. Instead, the exit
    code
    reflects the type of system error.
  - The undocumented ctx.expand feature no longer exists.
  - Make --legacy_dynamic_scheduler a no-op flag.
  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - native.existing_rule now returns a mutable list, not a tuple, for
    a list-valued attributes. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Roll back change to have native.existing_rules use list instead
    of tuple.
  - BEP includes test suite expansions.
  - config_setting now honors `visibility` attribute (and defaults to
    `//visibility:public`)
  - Change the MultiArchSplitTransitionProvider to be based on
    platform type + CPU instead of fixed "ios_" + cpu.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - add a flag to build v4 signature file
  - Added _direct_source_jars output group to Java related targets.
    END_PUBLIC
  - pkg_deb is no longer part of @bazel_tools//build_defs/pkg:pkg.bzl.
    Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/tree/main/pkg instead
  - Allowing the lipo operations to be conditional in the
    linkMultiArchBinary API for Apple binaries. Single architecture
    slices are now returned through AppleBinaryOutput and the
    Starlark API.
  - Release restriction for "-" in the package name for Python
    sources. Now `py_binary` and `py_test` targets can have main
    source file with "-" in the path.
  - Users consuming BEP may assume that a `named_set_of_files` event
    will
    appear before any event referencing that `named_set` by ID. This
    allows consumers
    to process the files for such events (eg. `TargetCompleted`)
    immediately.
  - BEP includes all files from successful actions in requested
    output groups.
    Previously, an output group's files were excluded if any file in
    the output group
    was not produced due to a failing action. Users can expect BEP
    output to be larger
    for failed builds.
  - In BEP, TargetComplete.output_group has a new field `incomplete`
    indicating that the file_sets field is missing one or more
    declared artifacts
    whose generating actions failed.
  - The flag `--toolchain_resolution_debug` now takes a regex
    argument, which is used to check which toolchain types should
    have debug info printed. You may use `.*` as an argument to keep
    the current behavior of debugging every toolchain type.
  - Add runfiles.merge_all() for merging a sequence of runfiles
    objects.
  - runfiles.merge() and merge_all() now respect
    --nested_set_depth_limit.
    If you hit the depth limit because you were calling merge() in a
    loop, use
    merge_all() on a sequence of runfiles objects instead.
  - Bazel will no longer create a bazel-out symlink if
    --symlink_prefix is specified: the directory pointed to via the
    bazel-out symlink is accessible via ${symlink_prefix}-out. If
    this causes problems for you, set
    --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink=false in your builds
    and file an issue.
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - Simplify build failure output by always using `NNN arguments`.
  - trim_test_configuration now defaults to on
  - Mark genrule.srcs as a source attribute for coverage.
  - When using --allow_analysis_failures (for example, via
    bazel-skylib's
    analysistest with `expect_failure = True`), analysis-time
    failures in aspect
    implementation functions will now be propagated and saved in
    AnalysisFailureInfo, just like analysis-time failures in rules.
  - cquery --noimplicit_deps now correctly filters out resolved
    cc_toolchains
  - Sign apks deterministically.
  - Make gcov optional in cc_toolchain tools.
  - If --experimental_prefer_mutual_xcode is passed, Bazel will
    choose the local default (instead of the newest mutually
    available version) if it's available both locally and remotely.
  - Remove java_lite_proto_library.strict_deps attribute.
  - Generate proguard configurations deterministically.
  - Adds a new flag, `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` which
    switches from the use of build variables to the feature of the
    same name.
  - Dropped fragile xz support from built in pkg_tar. Users requiring
    xz
    compression should switch to bazlebuild/rules_pkg.
  - If all strategies of one branch (the local or remote execution
    branch) of the `dynamic` strategy fail to even accept (via the
    response they give from `canExec`) the action, `dynamic` will now
    try to see if the other branch can accept it. (Trying to run it
    and it failing will still cause a failure if it was the first
    result, this is about strategies claiming they can't even try the
    action)
  - Add `disable_annotation_processing` option to
    `java_common.compile`, which disables any annotation processors
    passed to `plugins` or in `exported_plugins` of `deps`
  - Remove obsolete --incompatible_prohibit_aapt1
  - The minimum Android build tools version for the Android rules is
    now 30.0.0
  - Adds --experimental_reuse_sandbox_directories flag to reuse
    already-created non-worker sandboxes with cleanup.
  - --experimental_force_gc_after_build is deprecated and will be
    removed soon. Use --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build instead
  - Forward coverage-instrumented files from non-tool dependencies by
    default.
  - The used_heap_size_post_build field in BEP is populated when the
    --memory_profile flag is set
  - --run_validations defaults to true.
  - Consider label_keyed_string_dict attributes when gathering
    instrumented files for coverage.
  - Remove flag
    --experimental_forward_instrumented_files_info_by_default, now
    that this behavior is the default.
  - When using MemoryProfiler with multiple GCs via the
    --memory_profile_stable_heap_parameters flag, we do a more
    precise calculation of heap used at the end of the build. This
    will generally result in lower values.
  - --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build is deprecated. Use
    --memory_profile=/dev/null instead.
  - Disable --all_incompatible_changes flag.
  - The --all_incompatible_changes flag is now a no-op
  - The `--toolchain_resolution_debug` flag now accepts regexes
    matching targets, as well as toolchain types, when choosing what
    debug messages to print.
  - Adds --experimental_existing_rules_immutable_view flag to make the
    native.existing_rule and native.existing_rules functions more
    efficient by
    returning immutable, lightweight dict-like view objects instead
    of mutable
    dicts.
  - Add support to length-delimited protos as undeclared output
    annotations []
  - The deprecated "relative_to_caller_repository" parameter has been
    removed from the Label constructor.
  - The toolchain transition is now enabled for all toolchains.
  - incompatible_disable_depset_items is flipped
  - The --experimental_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    renamed to  --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view
  - Bazel no longer supports Java 8. From this version on, the
    minimum required JDK is OpenJDK 11.
  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13047.
    
    Closes #14310.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
    
    Closes #14971.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
    
    Closes #14849.
  - none
    RELNOTES:none
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
    
    Progress on https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15856
    
    Closes #15947.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
    
    Closes #15552.
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.

## Release 4.2.3 (2022-10-18)

```
Baseline: 37a429ad12b4c9e6a62dbae4881a1ff03b81ab40

Cherry picks:

   + a689d673abadf80f1efaf8ddaeee92d56fc2847b:
     Use getRunfilesPath for run_under executable path generation.
     getRootRelativePath doesn't return a valid runfiles path for
     external source files anymore after the recent external source
     root change. Also, it won't work for external labels either once
     the --nolegacy_external_runfiles becomes default. This fixes
     issue #12545.
   + d90ec67fdab9710f649a3c1d374fb6b938b9271a:

     [4.2.3] Update GrpcRemoteDownloader to only include relevant
     headers. (#16450) (#16459)
```

Incompatible changes:

  - GrpcRemoteDownloader only includes relevant headers instead of
    sending all credentials.
    
    Closes #16439.

Important changes:

  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - The minimum Android build tools version for the Android rules is
    now 30.0.0
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - If all strategies of one branch (the local or remote execution
    branch) of the `dynamic` strategy fail to even accept (via the
    response they give from `canExec`) the action, `dynamic` will now
    try to see if the other branch can accept it. (Trying to run it
    and it failing will still cause a failure if it was the first
    result, this is about strategies claiming they can't even try the
    action)

## Release 6.0.0-pre.20220922.1 (2022-09-30)

```
Baseline: 4e7d2a24715130ea5aec098e44f43fa603fad6b7
```

Incompatible changes:

  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since the path would refer to a
    netrc file inside the external repository by absolute path.
    Migration should be straightforward.
  - genrule switched to use exec transition instead of host. This can
    break targets with hardcoded output paths. To avoid using
    hardcoded paths use make variables, see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.2.2/be/make-variables.html#pre
    defined_label_variables
  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since...
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - The --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13907 for
    migration notes.
  - Split up the C++ archive from the C++ link action and set
    `CppArchive` as mnemonic.
  - workspace(managed_directories=) is not available anymore.
  - --legacy_important_outputs now has a default of false.
  - --legacy_important_outputs default reverted to true.
  - objc_library now requires CcInfo in its deps.  If this breaks
    you, add empty CcInfo() to your rule.
  - Flag --experimental_local_memory_estimate removed.
  - Added a new flag
    --incompatible_unambiguous_label_stringification, which causes
    labels in the main repo to stringify into unambiguous forms
    starting with an @. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15916 for more
    information.
  - analysis_test moved into testing.analysis_test

Important changes:

  - Deprecate --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag, in preparation
    for removal in Bazel 6.x.
  - Treat py_*.srcs_version="PY2" the same as "PY2ONLY".
  - The Build Event Protocol now contains file digests and sizes
    along with the file name and URI.
  - Refactor system suspend event handling.
  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
  - Allow \a \b \f \v escape sequences in Starlark.
  - Match remote and local xcode version by most granular version.
  - Adds `--experimental_worker_multiplex_sandboxing` flag that
    controls whether to sandbox multiplex workers that support it.
  - provider() has a new parameter: init, a callback for performing
    pre-processing and validation of field values. Iff this parameter
    is set,
    provider() returns a tuple of 2 elements: the usual provider
    symbol (which,
    when called, invokes init) and a raw constructor (which bypasses
    init).
  - Tests that fail to create or complete their
    `TestAttemptContinuation` by
    throwing an `ExecException` will report an `INCOMPLETE` status.
    Previously, Bazel
    would fail to report any status for the test attempt.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Include more information about configurations in cquery proto
    formatted output. This deprecates the configuration field of
    AnalysisProtosV2.ConfiguredTarget, and adds a new field,
    configuration_id, to
    be used instead.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - In aquery and cquery proto output, indicate if a configuration is
    a
    tool or non-tool configuration.
  - Include complete configurations in cquery proto output.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add some documentation about how configuration information is
    conveyed in cquery proto output.
  - Introduces experimental static library linking API under
    apple_common.link_multi_arch_static_library
  - Further deprecation and removal of pkg_tar. Stop supporting
    legacy use of 'files' attribute, where it could be a list of
    labels instead of a map of paths to labels.
  - Removed --incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg flag. It never fulfilled
    its purpose because --all_incompatible_changes would never set
    it. The last rule it gated (pkg_tar) is scheduled to be removed
    in Bazel 6.x.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - The default dexer is now d8. dx can be optionally enabled using:
      --define=android_dexmerger_tool=dx_dexmerger \
      --define=android_incremental_dexing_tool=dx_dexbuilder \
      --define=android_standalone_dexing_tool=dx_compat_dx \
      --use_workers_with_dexbuilder
  - Packaging support for deploy JAR embedded JDK files (hermetic
    Java).
  - Don't stamp cc_common.link actions for tool dependencies.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Allow specialization to work with constraint_values.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - Make ijar / java_import preserve classes with `@kotlin.Metadata`
    annotations
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Add devtools/build/lib/worker:work_request_handlers to the remote
    android tools release package. This will be transitively packaged
    into all_android_tools.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - Advance android_tools_pkg version to 0.24.0.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - "blaze config" now only reports info from the last build. To
    compare configurations across multiple builds, redirect "blaze
    config" output to a file and run your favorite diff tool.
  - The --incompatible_override_toolchain_transition flag is now
    always set, and will be removed in the future. Thus,
    --noincompatible_override_toolchain_transition has no effect, and
    the value of the incompatible_use_toolchain_transition parameter
    in aspect() and rule() builtins is ignored.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Toolchain types may now be optional, in addition to mandatory.
    See https://bazel.build/docs/toolchains#optional-toolchains for
    further details.
  - Add six to deps of has_services=1 py_proto_librarys.
  - pkg_tar(symlinks) has been removed. Users needing that feature
    should
    migrate to @rules_pkg.
  - Aspects can now define and use exec groups using the same API as
    rules.
  - Removed the obsolete --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag. The
    feature is permanently enabled.
  - embedded_tools packages R8 desugarer again
  - Bazel now selects sh path based on execution platform instead of
    host platform, making it possible to execute sh actions in
    multiplatform builds. --shell_executable now only applies to
    actions configured for host.
  - labels in genquery.scope are no longer configured.
  - When Bzlmod is enabled, all Bzlmod-generated repos will have an
    extra '@' prepended to their names. This effectively enables the
    canonical label literal syntax for Bzlmod-generated repos
    (`@@canonicalRepoName//pkg:target`; see
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N81qfCa8oskCk5LqTW-LNthy6EBrDo
    t7bdUsjz6JFC4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Exposed `CcSharedLibraryInfo` to Starlark builtins.
  - Enable --use_top_level_targets_for_symlinks by default.
  - Singlejar accepts runtime Created-By field
  - --noincompatible_disable_managed_directories, and with that,
    workspace(managed_directories=) is not supported anymore.
  - Bazel supports D8 desugaring, albeit without persistent workers
  - Remove mtime options from pkg_tar. Users should migrate to
    @rules_pkg.
  - Test for experimental multiplexed persistent resource processor.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - The legacy pkg_tar no longer supports the ability to untar and
    repackage an input tar file (`deps` attribute). Users needed that
    capability must switch to github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
  - Change singlejar metadata to report Created-By Bazel
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
  - Revert interface_deps back to implementation_deps after problem
    reported in. Use `buildozer 'rename deps implementation_deps'
    //...:%cc_library; buildozer 'rename interface_deps deps'
    //...:%cc_library`
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.
  - D8 is the default desugarer
  - Migrate main_dex_list_creator to D8 (DX deprecation)
  - --experimental_enable_bzlmod has been renamed --enable_bzlmod,
    and still defaults to false.
  - selects() no longer produce irrelevant duplicate label checks
  - Adds a dexer output cache to CompatDexBuilder to improve build
    speed.
  - Improved error messages when analyzing inline bzl code
  - Improved error messages when analyzing inline bzl code
  - The `@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler` flag now has the value
    `gcc` if the configured compiler is detected to be gcc rather
    than the generic value `compiler`. A branch for `gcc` may have to
    be added to `select` statements that do not have a default case
    that handles gcc appropriately.
  - The `get_child` method of `path` now accepts an arbitrary
    number of relative path strings as positional arguments.
  - SourceManifestAction supports `Action.content`
  - Add --incompatible_build_transitive_python_runfiles alias. See
    #16303
  - The @bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler flag now has the value
    `clang` for the auto-configured Xcode toolchain rather than the
    generic value compiler. A branch for `clang` may have to be added
    to select statements that do not have a default case that handles
    this toolchain appropriately.
  - added additional debug message to warn of skipped toolchains
    during resolution

Important changes:

  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13047.
    
    Closes #14310.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
    
    Closes #14971.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
    
    Closes #14849.
  - none
    RELNOTES:none
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
    
    Progress on https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15856
    
    Closes #15947.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
    
    Closes #15552.
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.

    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
    
    Closes #14971.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
    
    Closes #14849.
  - none
    RELNOTES:none
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.

Incompatible changes:

  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since the path would refer to a
    netrc file inside the external repository by absolute path.
    Migration should be straightforward.
  - genrule switched to use exec transition instead of host. This can
    break targets with hardcoded output paths. To avoid using
    hardcoded paths use make variables, see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.2.2/be/make-variables.html#pre
    defined_label_variables
  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since...
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - The --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13907 for
    migration notes.
  - Split up the C++ archive from the C++ link action and set
    `CppArchive` as mnemonic.
  - workspace(managed_directories=) is not available anymore.
  - --legacy_important_outputs now has a default of false.
  - --legacy_important_outputs default reverted to true.
  - objc_library now requires CcInfo in its deps.  If this breaks
    you, add empty CcInfo() to your rule.
  - Flag --experimental_local_memory_estimate removed.
  - Added a new flag
    --incompatible_unambiguous_label_stringification, which causes
    labels in the main repo to stringify into unambiguous forms
    starting with an @. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15916 for more
    information.

Important changes:

  - Deprecate --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag, in preparation
    for removal in Bazel 6.x.
  - Treat py_*.srcs_version="PY2" the same as "PY2ONLY".
  - The Build Event Protocol now contains file digests and sizes
    along with the file name and URI.
  - Refactor system suspend event handling.
  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
  - Allow \a \b \f \v escape sequences in Starlark.
  - Match remote and local xcode version by most granular version.
  - Adds `--experimental_worker_multiplex_sandboxing` flag that
    controls whether to sandbox multiplex workers that support it.
  - provider() has a new parameter: init, a callback for performing
    pre-processing and validation of field values. Iff this parameter
    is set,
    provider() returns a tuple of 2 elements: the usual provider
    symbol (which,
    when called, invokes init) and a raw constructor (which bypasses
    init).
  - Tests that fail to create or complete their
    `TestAttemptContinuation` by
    throwing an `ExecException` will report an `INCOMPLETE` status.
    Previously, Bazel
    would fail to report any status for the test attempt.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Include more information about configurations in cquery proto
    formatted output. This deprecates the configuration field of
    AnalysisProtosV2.ConfiguredTarget, and adds a new field,
    configuration_id, to
    be used instead.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - In aquery and cquery proto output, indicate if a configuration is
    a
    tool or non-tool configuration.
  - Include complete configurations in cquery proto output.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add some documentation about how configuration information is
    conveyed in cquery proto output.
  - Introduces experimental static library linking API under
    apple_common.link_multi_arch_static_library
  - Further deprecation and removal of pkg_tar. Stop supporting
    legacy use of 'files' attribute, where it could be a list of
    labels instead of a map of paths to labels.
  - Removed --incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg flag. It never fulfilled
    its purpose because --all_incompatible_changes would never set
    it. The last rule it gated (pkg_tar) is scheduled to be removed
    in Bazel 6.x.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - The default dexer is now d8. dx can be optionally enabled using:
      --define=android_dexmerger_tool=dx_dexmerger \
      --define=android_incremental_dexing_tool=dx_dexbuilder \
      --define=android_standalone_dexing_tool=dx_compat_dx \
      --use_workers_with_dexbuilder
  - Packaging support for deploy JAR embedded JDK files (hermetic
    Java).
  - Don't stamp cc_common.link actions for tool dependencies.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Allow specialization to work with constraint_values.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - Make ijar / java_import preserve classes with `@kotlin.Metadata`
    annotations
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Add devtools/build/lib/worker:work_request_handlers to the remote
    android tools release package. This will be transitively packaged
    into all_android_tools.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - Advance android_tools_pkg version to 0.24.0.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - "blaze config" now only reports info from the last build. To
    compare configurations across multiple builds, redirect "blaze
    config" output to a file and run your favorite diff tool.
  - The --incompatible_override_toolchain_transition flag is now
    always set, and will be removed in the future. Thus,
    --noincompatible_override_toolchain_transition has no effect, and
    the value of the incompatible_use_toolchain_transition parameter
    in aspect() and rule() builtins is ignored.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Toolchain types may now be optional, in addition to mandatory.
    See https://bazel.build/docs/toolchains#optional-toolchains for
    further details.
  - Add six to deps of has_services=1 py_proto_librarys.
  - pkg_tar(symlinks) has been removed. Users needing that feature
    should
    migrate to @rules_pkg.
  - Aspects can now define and use exec groups using the same API as
    rules.
  - Removed the obsolete --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag. The
    feature is permanently enabled.
  - embedded_tools packages R8 desugarer again
  - Bazel now selects sh path based on execution platform instead of
    host platform, making it possible to execute sh actions in
    multiplatform builds. --shell_executable now only applies to
    actions configured for host.
  - labels in genquery.scope are no longer configured.
  - When Bzlmod is enabled, all Bzlmod-generated repos will have an
    extra '@' prepended to their names. This effectively enables the
    canonical label literal syntax for Bzlmod-generated repos
    (`@@canonicalRepoName//pkg:target`; see
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N81qfCa8oskCk5LqTW-LNthy6EBrDo
    t7bdUsjz6JFC4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Exposed `CcSharedLibraryInfo` to Starlark builtins.
  - Enable --use_top_level_targets_for_symlinks by default.
  - Singlejar accepts runtime Created-By field
  - --noincompatible_disable_managed_directories, and with that,
    workspace(managed_directories=) is not supported anymore.
  - Bazel supports D8 desugaring, albeit without persistent workers
  - Remove mtime options from pkg_tar. Users should migrate to
    @rules_pkg.
  - Test for experimental multiplexed persistent resource processor.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - The legacy pkg_tar no longer supports the ability to untar and
    repackage an input tar file (`deps` attribute). Users needed that
    capability must switch to github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
  - Change singlejar metadata to report Created-By Bazel
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
  - Revert interface_deps back to implementation_deps after problem
    reported in. Use `buildozer 'rename deps implementation_deps'
    //...:%cc_library; buildozer 'rename interface_deps deps'
    //...:%cc_library`
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.
  - D8 is the default desugarer
  - Migrate main_dex_list_creator to D8 (DX deprecation)

```

Important changes:

  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13047.
    
    Closes #14310.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
    
    Closes #14971.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
    
    Closes #14849.
  - none
    RELNOTES:none
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
    
    Progress on https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15856
    
    Closes #15947.
  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
    
    Closes #15552.
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.

    labels in the main repo to stringify into unambiguous forms
    starting with an @. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/15916 for more
    information.

This release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as Philipp Schrader.

## Release 6.0.0-pre.20220804.3 (2022-08-11)

```
Baseline: 8152657c82b542a3da2ed39333941beefdeeeece
```

Important changes:

  - `cquery`'s new output mode
    [`--output=files`](https://bazel.build/docs/cquery#files-output)
    lists the output files of the targets matching the query. It
    takes the current value of `--output_groups` into account.
  - Change singlejar metadata to report Created-By Bazel
  - Add support for fetching RPC credentials from credential helper.
  - Revert interface_deps back to implementation_deps after problem
    reported in. Use `buildozer 'rename deps implementation_deps'
    //...:%cc_library; buildozer 'rename interface_deps deps'
    //...:%cc_library`
  - Fix for desugaring failure on Bazel+Android+Windows build
    scenario.
  - D8 is the default desugarer

Cherry picks:

   + f706da832996ab30ddd8784f2af697a3bb62852b:
     Requires delayed release
```

Important changes:

  - Added new register_{execution_platforms,toolchains} directives to
    the MODULE.bazel file, to replace the
    {execution_platforms,toolchains}_to_register attributes on the
    module() directive.
  - The legacy pkg_tar no longer supports the ability to untar and
    repackage an input tar file (`deps` attribute). Users needed that
    capability must switch to github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg.

```

Incompatible changes:

## Release 6.0.0-pre.20220630.1 (2022-07-11)

```
Baseline: fbf9277975ceb7be5255fd5cf449e22706d25d3f
```

Important changes:

  - Removed the obsolete --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag. The
    feature is permanently enabled.
  - embedded_tools packages R8 desugarer again
  - Bazel now selects sh path based on execution platform instead of
    host platform, making it possible to execute sh actions in
    multiplatform builds. --shell_executable now only applies to
    actions configured for host.
  - labels in genquery.scope are no longer configured.
  - When Bzlmod is enabled, all Bzlmod-generated repos will have an
    extra '@' prepended to their names. This effectively enables the
    canonical label literal syntax for Bzlmod-generated repos
    (`@@canonicalRepoName//pkg:target`; see
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N81qfCa8oskCk5LqTW-LNthy6EBrDo
    t7bdUsjz6JFC4/edit?usp=sharing).
  - Exposed `CcSharedLibraryInfo` to Starlark builtins.
  - Enable --use_top_level_targets_for_symlinks by default.
  - Singlejar accepts runtime Created-By field
  - --noincompatible_disable_managed_directories, and with that,
    workspace(managed_directories=) is not supported anymore.
  - Bazel supports D8 desugaring, albeit without persistent workers
  - Remove mtime options from pkg_tar. Users should migrate to
    @rules_pkg.
  - Test for experimental multiplexed persistent resource processor.

    rules.

```

```

Incompatible changes:

  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since the path would refer to a
    netrc file inside the external repository by absolute path.
    Migration should be straightforward.
  - genrule switched to use exec transition instead of host. This can
    break targets with hardcoded output paths. To avoid using
    hardcoded paths use make variables, see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.2.2/be/make-variables.html#pre
    defined_label_variables
  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since...
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - The --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13907 for
    migration notes.
  - Split up the C++ archive from the C++ link action and set
    `CppArchive` as mnemonic.
  - workspace(managed_directories=) is not available anymore.
  - --legacy_important_outputs now has a default of false.
  - --legacy_important_outputs default reverted to true.
  - objc_library now requires CcInfo in its deps.  If this breaks
    you, add empty CcInfo() to your rule.

Important changes:

  - Deprecate --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag, in preparation
    for removal in Bazel 6.x.
  - Treat py_*.srcs_version="PY2" the same as "PY2ONLY".
  - The Build Event Protocol now contains file digests and sizes
    along with the file name and URI.
  - Refactor system suspend event handling.
  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
  - Allow \a \b \f \v escape sequences in Starlark.
  - Match remote and local xcode version by most granular version.
  - Adds `--experimental_worker_multiplex_sandboxing` flag that
    controls whether to sandbox multiplex workers that support it.
  - provider() has a new parameter: init, a callback for performing
    pre-processing and validation of field values. Iff this parameter
    is set,
    provider() returns a tuple of 2 elements: the usual provider
    symbol (which,
    when called, invokes init) and a raw constructor (which bypasses
    init).
  - Tests that fail to create or complete their
    `TestAttemptContinuation` by
    throwing an `ExecException` will report an `INCOMPLETE` status.
    Previously, Bazel
    would fail to report any status for the test attempt.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Include more information about configurations in cquery proto
    formatted output. This deprecates the configuration field of
    AnalysisProtosV2.ConfiguredTarget, and adds a new field,
    configuration_id, to
    be used instead.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - In aquery and cquery proto output, indicate if a configuration is
    a
    tool or non-tool configuration.
  - Include complete configurations in cquery proto output.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add some documentation about how configuration information is
    conveyed in cquery proto output.
  - Introduces experimental static library linking API under
    apple_common.link_multi_arch_static_library
  - Further deprecation and removal of pkg_tar. Stop supporting
    legacy use of 'files' attribute, where it could be a list of
    labels instead of a map of paths to labels.
  - Removed --incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg flag. It never fulfilled
    its purpose because --all_incompatible_changes would never set
    it. The last rule it gated (pkg_tar) is scheduled to be removed
    in Bazel 6.x.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - The default dexer is now d8. dx can be optionally enabled using:
      --define=android_dexmerger_tool=dx_dexmerger \
      --define=android_incremental_dexing_tool=dx_dexbuilder \
      --define=android_standalone_dexing_tool=dx_compat_dx \
      --use_workers_with_dexbuilder
  - Packaging support for deploy JAR embedded JDK files (hermetic
    Java).
  - Don't stamp cc_common.link actions for tool dependencies.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.
  - Allow specialization to work with constraint_values.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - Make ijar / java_import preserve classes with `@kotlin.Metadata`
    annotations
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather than always linking statically when Windows is
    the _host_).
  - Add devtools/build/lib/worker:work_request_handlers to the remote
    android tools release package. This will be transitively packaged
    into all_android_tools.
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - Advance android_tools_pkg version to 0.24.0.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - "blaze config" now only reports info from the last build. To
    compare configurations across multiple builds, redirect "blaze
    config" output to a file and run your favorite diff tool.
  - The --incompatible_override_toolchain_transition flag is now
    always set, and will be removed in the future. Thus,
    --noincompatible_override_toolchain_transition has no effect, and
    the value of the incompatible_use_toolchain_transition parameter
    in aspect() and rule() builtins is ignored.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Toolchain types may now be optional, in addition to mandatory.
    See https://bazel.build/docs/toolchains#optional-toolchains for
    further details.
  - Add six to deps of has_services=1 py_proto_librarys.
  - pkg_tar(symlinks) has been removed. Users needing that feature
    should
    migrate to @rules_pkg.

```

Important changes:

  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13047.
    
    Closes #14310.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
    
    Closes #14971.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
    
    Closes #14849.

```
Baseline: e6bb6fcfcc9b571ef0bbdf039b5ae67954ade222
```

Incompatible changes:

  - --legacy_important_outputs now has a default of false.
  - --legacy_important_outputs default reverted to true.

Important changes:

  - pkg_tar(symlinks) has been removed. Users needing that feature
    should
    migrate to @rules_pkg.

## Release 6.0.0-pre.20220517.1 (2022-05-23)

```
Baseline: 61fd06d92706d64fbcef64f0f54cded91c88afff
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Split up the C++ archive from the C++ link action and set
    `CppArchive` as mnemonic.

Important changes:

  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Bazel uses the D8 jar from Maven instead of the SDK.
  - "blaze config" now only reports info from the last build. To
    compare configurations across multiple builds, redirect "blaze
    config" output to a file and run your favorite diff tool.
  - The --incompatible_override_toolchain_transition flag is now
    always set, and will be removed in the future. Thus,
    --noincompatible_override_toolchain_transition has no effect, and
    the value of the incompatible_use_toolchain_transition parameter
    in aspect() and rule() builtins is ignored.
  - Switch cc_test implementation to Starlark. Note: cc_test will now
    link statically when _targeting_ Windows regardless of host
    platform (rather
    than always linking statically when Windows is the _host_).
  - Toolchain types may now be optional, in addition to mandatory.
    See https://bazel.build/docs/toolchains#optional-toolchains for
    further details.

Incompatible changes:

  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since the path would refer to a
    netrc file inside the external repository by absolute path.
    Migration should be straightforward.
  - genrule switched to use exec transition instead of host. This can
    break targets with hardcoded output paths. To avoid using
    hardcoded paths use make variables, see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/4.2.2/be/make-variables.html#pre
    defined_label_variables
  - this incompatible change breaks old instances of http_archive
    that specified netrc as an absolute path. It is unlikely there
    are many instances in the wild since...
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - Error Prone now checks for unused return values of additional
    methods on `java.lang.Object`, which can be disabled using
    `--javacopts=-Xep:ReturnValueIgnored:OFF`
  - The --incompatible_existing_rules_immutable_view flag has been
    flipped to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13907 for
    migration notes.

Important changes:

  - Deprecate --incompatible_applicable_licenses flag, in preparation
    for removal in Bazel 6.x.
  - Treat py_*.srcs_version="PY2" the same as "PY2ONLY".
  - The Build Event Protocol now contains file digests and sizes
    along with the file name and URI.
  - Refactor system suspend event handling.
  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
  - Allow \a \b \f \v escape sequences in Starlark.
  - Match remote and local xcode version by most granular version.
  - Adds `--experimental_worker_multiplex_sandboxing` flag that
    controls whether to sandbox multiplex workers that support it.
  - provider() has a new parameter: init, a callback for performing
    pre-processing and validation of field values. Iff this parameter
    is set,
    provider() returns a tuple of 2 elements: the usual provider
    symbol (which,
    when called, invokes init) and a raw constructor (which bypasses
    init).
  - Tests that fail to create or complete their
    `TestAttemptContinuation` by
    throwing an `ExecException` will report an `INCOMPLETE` status.
    Previously, Bazel
    would fail to report any status for the test attempt.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Include more information about configurations in cquery proto
    formatted output. This deprecates the configuration field of
    AnalysisProtosV2.ConfiguredTarget, and adds a new field,
    configuration_id, to
    be used instead.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - In aquery and cquery proto output, indicate if a configuration is
    a
    tool or non-tool configuration.
  - Include complete configurations in cquery proto output.
  - experimental cc_library.implementation_deps inverted to
    interface_deps
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add some documentation about how configuration information is
    conveyed in cquery proto output.
  - Introduces experimental static library linking API under
    apple_common.link_multi_arch_static_library
  - Further deprecation and removal of pkg_tar. Stop supporting
    legacy use of 'files' attribute, where it could be a list of
    labels instead of a map of paths to labels.
  - Removed --incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg flag. It never fulfilled
    its purpose because --all_incompatible_changes would never set
    it. The last rule it gated (pkg_tar) is scheduled to be removed
    in Bazel 6.x.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
  - android_sdk_repository read $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT in addition to
    $ANDROID_HOME.
  - The default dexer is now d8. dx can be optionally enabled using:
      --define=android_dexmerger_tool=dx_dexmerger \
      --define=android_incremental_dexing_tool=dx_dexbuilder \
      --define=android_standalone_dexing_tool=dx_compat_dx \
      --use_workers_with_dexbuilder
  - Packaging support for deploy JAR embedded JDK files (hermetic
    Java).
  - Don't stamp cc_common.link actions for tool dependencies.
  - Starlark test rules can use the new inherited_environment
    parameter of testing.TestEnvironment to specify environment
    variables
    whose values should be inherited from the shell environment.
  - Enable merging permissions during Android manifest merging with
    the --merge_android_manifest_permissions flag.

Important changes:

  - alias() can now select() directly on constraint_value()
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13047.
    
    Closes #14310.
  - Fixed an issue where Bazel could erroneously report a test passes
    in coverage mode without actually running the test.
  - Make protocOpts() publicly accessible.
  - Add coverage configuration fragment, used to expose
    output_generator label.
  - Bazel now no longer includes system headers on macOS in coverage
    reports (#14969).
    
    Closes #14971.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Removing java_common.javac_jar Starlark call.
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change
    because there is some code that relies on the precise type
    returned, including brittle workarounds for this bug specifically
    and insufficiently flexible workarounds for other issues with the
    intersection of select and native.existing_rule.
  - flipped incompatible_use_toolchain_resolution_for_java_rules, see
    #7849
  - Query output=xml/proto/location for source files will now show
    the location of line 1 of the source file (as the new default)
    instead of its location in the BUILD file.
  - Specifying a target pattern underneath a directory specified by
    .bazelignore will now emit a warning, not an error.
  - Query `--order_output=auto` will now sort lexicographically.
    However, when `somepath` is used as a top level function (e.g.
    `query 'somepath(a, b)'`), it will continue to output in
    dependency order. If you do not want the lexicographical output
    ordering, specify another `--order_output` value (`no`, `deps` or
    `full`) based on what ordering you require.
  - In the build event stream,
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_loaded is no longer populated.
    Its value was always mostly meaningless.
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_configured and
    BuildMetrics.ActionSummary.actions_created now include configured
    aspect data.
  - //visibility:legacy_public has been removed.
  - Flip and remove incompatible_dont_collect_so_artifacts
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13043).
  - Remove flag --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink: it is
    always true.
  - The Starlark method generate_dsym in objc fragment has
    been deleted.  Please use the equivalent apple_generate_dsym in
    cpp
    fragment instead.
  - Native libraries in data attribute are not collected. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13550 for details
  - Enforce the `--profile` path to be absolute.
  - Enforce the --memory_profile path to be absolute.
  - JavaToolchainInfo.jvm_opt returns Depset instead of a list.
  - --apple_sdk has been deleted.  It is a no-op.
  - --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build is now a no-op and will
    be deleted in a future release. Use --memory_profile=/dev/null
    instead.
  - Flipped --incompatible_disallow_resource_jars (see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13221).

New features:

  - Args.add_all and Args.add_joined can now accept closures in
    map_each if explicitly enabled via allow_closure.
  - Add `--bes_header` flag to pass extra headers to the BES server.

Important changes:

  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - none
    PAIR=cmita
  - The --incompatible_load_python_rules_from_bzl flag is now a no-op.
  - Filter all (instead of just C++) source files for coverage output
    according to --instrumentation_filter and
    --instrument_test_targets.
  - The `--incompatible_disable_native_apple_binary_rule` flag has
    been added which disables the native `apple_binary` rule. Users
    who need to use `apple_binary` directly (if they cannot use one
    of the more specific Apple rules) should load it from
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple.
  - The Android rules' --use_singlejar_apkbuilder is now a no-op.
    SingleJar will always be used to build APKs.
  - dict.setdefault(key, ...) now fails if dict is frozen, even if it
    already contains key. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info is removed.
     See #11359.
  - Starlark now permits def statements to be nested (closures).
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change,
    though the fallout is expected to be small.
  - Starlark now supports lambda (anonymous function) expressions.
  - The "test" and "coverage" commands no longer return 3 when a
    test action fails because of a system error. Instead, the exit
    code
    reflects the type of system error.
  - The undocumented ctx.expand feature no longer exists.
  - Make --legacy_dynamic_scheduler a no-op flag.
  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - native.existing_rule now returns a mutable list, not a tuple, for
    a list-valued attributes. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Roll back change to have native.existing_rules use list instead
    of tuple.
  - BEP includes test suite expansions.
  - config_setting now honors `visibility` attribute (and defaults to
    `//visibility:public`)
  - Change the MultiArchSplitTransitionProvider to be based on
    platform type + CPU instead of fixed "ios_" + cpu.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - add a flag to build v4 signature file
  - Added _direct_source_jars output group to Java related targets.
    END_PUBLIC
  - pkg_deb is no longer part of @bazel_tools//build_defs/pkg:pkg.bzl.
    Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/tree/main/pkg instead
  - Allowing the lipo operations to be conditional in the
    linkMultiArchBinary API for Apple binaries. Single architecture
    slices are now returned through AppleBinaryOutput and the
    Starlark API.
  - Release restriction for "-" in the package name for Python
    sources. Now `py_binary` and `py_test` targets can have main
    source file with "-" in the path.
  - Users consuming BEP may assume that a `named_set_of_files` event
    will
    appear before any event referencing that `named_set` by ID. This
    allows consumers
    to process the files for such events (eg. `TargetCompleted`)
    immediately.
  - BEP includes all files from successful actions in requested
    output groups.
    Previously, an output group's files were excluded if any file in
    the output group
    was not produced due to a failing action. Users can expect BEP
    output to be larger
    for failed builds.
  - In BEP, TargetComplete.output_group has a new field `incomplete`
    indicating that the file_sets field is missing one or more
    declared artifacts
    whose generating actions failed.
  - The flag `--toolchain_resolution_debug` now takes a regex
    argument, which is used to check which toolchain types should
    have debug info printed. You may use `.*` as an argument to keep
    the current behavior of debugging every toolchain type.
  - Add runfiles.merge_all() for merging a sequence of runfiles
    objects.
  - runfiles.merge() and merge_all() now respect
    --nested_set_depth_limit.
    If you hit the depth limit because you were calling merge() in a
    loop, use
    merge_all() on a sequence of runfiles objects instead.
  - Bazel will no longer create a bazel-out symlink if
    --symlink_prefix is specified: the directory pointed to via the
    bazel-out symlink is accessible via ${symlink_prefix}-out. If
    this causes problems for you, set
    --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink=false in your builds
    and file an issue.
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - Simplify build failure output by always using `NNN arguments`.
  - trim_test_configuration now defaults to on
  - Mark genrule.srcs as a source attribute for coverage.
  - When using --allow_analysis_failures (for example, via
    bazel-skylib's
    analysistest with `expect_failure = True`), analysis-time
    failures in aspect
    implementation functions will now be propagated and saved in
    AnalysisFailureInfo, just like analysis-time failures in rules.
  - cquery --noimplicit_deps now correctly filters out resolved
    cc_toolchains
  - Sign apks deterministically.
  - Make gcov optional in cc_toolchain tools.
  - If --experimental_prefer_mutual_xcode is passed, Bazel will
    choose the local default (instead of the newest mutually
    available version) if it's available both locally and remotely.
  - Remove java_lite_proto_library.strict_deps attribute.
  - Generate proguard configurations deterministically.
  - Adds a new flag, `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` which
    switches from the use of build variables to the feature of the
    same name.
  - Dropped fragile xz support from built in pkg_tar. Users requiring
    xz
    compression should switch to bazlebuild/rules_pkg.
  - If all strategies of one branch (the local or remote execution
    branch) of the `dynamic` strategy fail to even accept (via the
    response they give from `canExec`) the action, `dynamic` will now
    try to see if the other branch can accept it. (Trying to run it
    and it failing will still cause a failure if it was the first
    result, this is about strategies claiming they can't even try the
    action)
  - Add `disable_annotation_processing` option to
    `java_common.compile`, which disables any annotation processors
    passed to `plugins` or in `exported_plugins` of `deps`
  - Remove obsolete --incompatible_prohibit_aapt1
  - The minimum Android build tools version for the Android rules is
    now 30.0.0
  - Adds --experimental_reuse_sandbox_directories flag to reuse
    already-created non-worker sandboxes with cleanup.
  - --experimental_force_gc_after_build is deprecated and will be
    removed soon. Use --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build instead
  - Forward coverage-instrumented files from non-tool dependencies by
    default.
  - The used_heap_size_post_build field in BEP is populated when the
    --memory_profile flag is set
  - --run_validations defaults to true.
  - Consider label_keyed_string_dict attributes when gathering
    instrumented files for coverage.
  - Remove flag
    --experimental_forward_instrumented_files_info_by_default, now
    that this behavior is the default.
  - When using MemoryProfiler with multiple GCs via the
    --memory_profile_stable_heap_parameters flag, we do a more
    precise calculation of heap used at the end of the build. This
    will generally result in lower values.
  - --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build is deprecated. Use
    --memory_profile=/dev/null instead.
  - Disable --all_incompatible_changes flag.

Important changes:

  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - The minimum Android build tools version for the Android rules is
    now 30.0.0
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - If all strategies of one branch (the local or remote execution
    branch) of the `dynamic` strategy fail to even accept (via the
    response they give from `canExec`) the action, `dynamic` will now
    try to see if the other branch can accept it. (Trying to run it
    and it failing will still cause a failure if it was the first
    result, this is about strategies claiming they can't even try the
    action)

     Add incompatible flag to guard top-level aspects dependencies
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Removing java_common.javac_jar Starlark call.
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change
    because there is some code that relies on the precise type
    returned, including brittle workarounds for this bug specifically
    and insufficiently flexible workarounds for other issues with the
    intersection of select and native.existing_rule.
  - flipped incompatible_use_toolchain_resolution_for_java_rules, see
    #7849
  - Query output=xml/proto/location for source files will now show
    the location of line 1 of the source file (as the new default)
    instead of its location in the BUILD file.
  - Specifying a target pattern underneath a directory specified by
    .bazelignore will now emit a warning, not an error.
  - Query `--order_output=auto` will now sort lexicographically.
    However, when `somepath` is used as a top level function (e.g.
    `query 'somepath(a, b)'`), it will continue to output in
    dependency order. If you do not want the lexicographical output
    ordering, specify another `--order_output` value (`no`, `deps` or
    `full`) based on what ordering you require.
  - In the build event stream,
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_loaded is no longer populated.
    Its value was always mostly meaningless.
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_configured and
    BuildMetrics.ActionSummary.actions_created now include configured
    aspect data.
  - //visibility:legacy_public has been removed.
  - Flip and remove incompatible_dont_collect_so_artifacts
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13043).
  - Remove flag --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink: it is
    always true.
  - The Starlark method generate_dsym in objc fragment has
    been deleted.  Please use the equivalent apple_generate_dsym in
    cpp
    fragment instead.
  - Native libraries in data attribute are not collected. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13550 for details
  - Enforce the `--profile` path to be absolute.
  - Enforce the --memory_profile path to be absolute.
  - JavaToolchainInfo.jvm_opt returns Depset instead of a list.
  - --apple_sdk has been deleted.  It is a no-op.

Important changes:

  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - none
    PAIR=cmita
  - The --incompatible_load_python_rules_from_bzl flag is now a no-op.
  - Filter all (instead of just C++) source files for coverage output
    according to --instrumentation_filter and
    --instrument_test_targets.
  - The `--incompatible_disable_native_apple_binary_rule` flag has
    been added which disables the native `apple_binary` rule. Users
    who need to use `apple_binary` directly (if they cannot use one
    of the more specific Apple rules) should load it from
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple.
  - The Android rules' --use_singlejar_apkbuilder is now a no-op.
    SingleJar will always be used to build APKs.
  - dict.setdefault(key, ...) now fails if dict is frozen, even if it
    already contains key. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info is removed.
     See #11359.
  - Starlark now permits def statements to be nested (closures).
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change,
    though the fallout is expected to be small.
  - Starlark now supports lambda (anonymous function) expressions.
  - The "test" and "coverage" commands no longer return 3 when a
    test action fails because of a system error. Instead, the exit
    code
    reflects the type of system error.
  - The undocumented ctx.expand feature no longer exists.
  - Make --legacy_dynamic_scheduler a no-op flag.
  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - native.existing_rule now returns a mutable list, not a tuple, for
    a list-valued attributes. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Roll back change to have native.existing_rules use list instead
    of tuple.
  - BEP includes test suite expansions.
  - config_setting now honors `visibility` attribute (and defaults to
    `//visibility:public`)
  - Change the MultiArchSplitTransitionProvider to be based on
    platform type + CPU instead of fixed "ios_" + cpu.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - add a flag to build v4 signature file
  - Added _direct_source_jars output group to Java related targets.
    END_PUBLIC
  - pkg_deb is no longer part of @bazel_tools//build_defs/pkg:pkg.bzl.
    Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/tree/main/pkg instead
  - Allowing the lipo operations to be conditional in the
    linkMultiArchBinary API for Apple binaries. Single architecture
    slices are now returned through AppleBinaryOutput and the
    Starlark API.
  - Release restriction for "-" in the package name for Python
    sources. Now `py_binary` and `py_test` targets can have main
    source file with "-" in the path.
  - Users consuming BEP may assume that a `named_set_of_files` event
    will
    appear before any event referencing that `named_set` by ID. This
    allows consumers
    to process the files for such events (eg. `TargetCompleted`)
    immediately.
  - BEP includes all files from successful actions in requested
    output groups.
    Previously, an output group's files were excluded if any file in
    the output group
    was not produced due to a failing action. Users can expect BEP
    output to be larger
    for failed builds.
  - In BEP, TargetComplete.output_group has a new field `incomplete`
    indicating that the file_sets field is missing one or more
    declared artifacts
    whose generating actions failed.
  - The flag `--toolchain_resolution_debug` now takes a regex
    argument, which is used to check which toolchain types should
    have debug info printed. You may use `.*` as an argument to keep
    the current behavior of debugging every toolchain type.
  - Add runfiles.merge_all() for merging a sequence of runfiles
    objects.
  - runfiles.merge() and merge_all() now respect
    --nested_set_depth_limit.
    If you hit the depth limit because you were calling merge() in a
    loop, use
    merge_all() on a sequence of runfiles objects instead.
  - Bazel will no longer create a bazel-out symlink if
    --symlink_prefix is specified: the directory pointed to via the
    bazel-out symlink is accessible via ${symlink_prefix}-out. If
    this causes problems for you, set
    --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink=false in your builds
    and file an issue.
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - Simplify build failure output by always using `NNN arguments`.
  - trim_test_configuration now defaults to on
  - Mark genrule.srcs as a source attribute for coverage.
  - When using --allow_analysis_failures (for example, via
    bazel-skylib's
    analysistest with `expect_failure = True`), analysis-time
    failures in aspect
    implementation functions will now be propagated and saved in
    AnalysisFailureInfo, just like analysis-time failures in rules.
  - cquery --noimplicit_deps now correctly filters out resolved
    cc_toolchains
  - Sign apks deterministically.
  - Make gcov optional in cc_toolchain tools.
  - If --experimental_prefer_mutual_xcode is passed, Bazel will
    choose the local default (instead of the newest mutually
    available version) if it's available both locally and remotely.
  - Remove java_lite_proto_library.strict_deps attribute.
  - Generate proguard configurations deterministically.
  - Adds a new flag, `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` which
    switches from the use of build variables to the feature of the
    same name.
  - Dropped fragile xz support from built in pkg_tar. Users requiring
    xz
    compression should switch to bazlebuild/rules_pkg.
  - If all strategies of one branch (the local or remote execution
    branch) of the `dynamic` strategy fail to even accept (via the
    response they give from `canExec`) the action, `dynamic` will now
    try to see if the other branch can accept it. (Trying to run it
    and it failing will still cause a failure if it was the first
    result, this is about strategies claiming they can't even try the
    action)
  - Add `disable_annotation_processing` option to
    `java_common.compile`, which disables any annotation processors
    passed to `plugins` or in `exported_plugins` of `deps`
  - Remove obsolete --incompatible_prohibit_aapt1
  - The minimum Android build tools version for the Android rules is
    now 30.0.0
  - Adds --experimental_reuse_sandbox_directories flag to reuse
    already-created non-worker sandboxes with cleanup.
  - --experimental_force_gc_after_build is deprecated and will be
    removed soon. Use --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build instead
  - Forward coverage-instrumented files from non-tool dependencies by
    default.
  - The used_heap_size_post_build field in BEP is populated when the
    --memory_profile flag is set
  - --run_validations defaults to true.
  - Consider label_keyed_string_dict attributes when gathering
    instrumented files for coverage.
  - Remove flag
    --experimental_forward_instrumented_files_info_by_default, now
    that this behavior is the default.
  - When using MemoryProfiler with multiple GCs via the
    --memory_profile_stable_heap_parameters flag, we do a more
    precise calculation of heap used at the end of the build. This
    will generally result in lower values.
  - --bep_publish_used_heap_size_post_build is deprecated. Use
    --memory_profile=/dev/null instead.

     Use getRunfilesPath for run_under executable path generation.
     getRootRelativePath doesn't return a valid runfiles path for

Important changes:

  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - The minimum Android build tools version for the Android rules is
    now 30.0.0
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - If all strategies of one branch (the local or remote execution
    branch) of the `dynamic` strategy fail to even accept (via the
    response they give from `canExec`) the action, `dynamic` will now
    try to see if the other branch can accept it. (Trying to run it
    and it failing will still cause a failure if it was the first
    result, this is about strategies claiming they can't even try the
    action)

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Removing java_common.javac_jar Starlark call.
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change
    because there is some code that relies on the precise type
    returned, including brittle workarounds for this bug specifically
    and insufficiently flexible workarounds for other issues with the
    intersection of select and native.existing_rule.
  - flipped incompatible_use_toolchain_resolution_for_java_rules, see
    #7849
  - Query output=xml/proto/location for source files will now show
    the location of line 1 of the source file (as the new default)
    instead of its location in the BUILD file.
  - Specifying a target pattern underneath a directory specified by
    .bazelignore will now emit a warning, not an error.
  - Query `--order_output=auto` will now sort lexicographically.
    However, when `somepath` is used as a top level function (e.g.
    `query 'somepath(a, b)'`), it will continue to output in
    dependency order. If you do not want the lexicographical output
    ordering, specify another `--order_output` value (`no`, `deps` or
    `full`) based on what ordering you require.
  - In the build event stream,
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_loaded is no longer populated.
    Its value was always mostly meaningless.
    BuildMetrics.TargetMetrics.targets_configured and
    BuildMetrics.ActionSummary.actions_created now include configured
    aspect data.
  - //visibility:legacy_public has been removed.
  - Flip and remove incompatible_dont_collect_so_artifacts
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/13043).
  - Remove flag --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink: it is
    always true.
  - The Starlark method generate_dsym in objc fragment has
    been deleted.  Please use the equivalent apple_generate_dsym in
    cpp
    fragment instead.

Important changes:

  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration is removed.  See
    #10854.
  - none
    PAIR=cmita
  - The --incompatible_load_python_rules_from_bzl flag is now a no-op.
  - Filter all (instead of just C++) source files for coverage output
    according to --instrumentation_filter and
    --instrument_test_targets.
  - The `--incompatible_disable_native_apple_binary_rule` flag has
    been added which disables the native `apple_binary` rule. Users
    who need to use `apple_binary` directly (if they cannot use one
    of the more specific Apple rules) should load it from
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple.
  - The Android rules' --use_singlejar_apkbuilder is now a no-op.
    SingleJar will always be used to build APKs.
  - dict.setdefault(key, ...) now fails if dict is frozen, even if it
    already contains key. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Flag --incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info is removed.
     See #11359.
  - Starlark now permits def statements to be nested (closures).
  - native.existing_rule now returns select values in a form that is
    accepted by rule instantiation. This is a breaking API change,
    though the fallout is expected to be small.
  - Starlark now supports lambda (anonymous function) expressions.
  - The "test" and "coverage" commands no longer return 3 when a
    test action fails because of a system error. Instead, the exit
    code
    reflects the type of system error.
  - The undocumented ctx.expand feature no longer exists.
  - Make --legacy_dynamic_scheduler a no-op flag.
  - Multiplex persistent workers can now use the JSON protocol.
  - native.existing_rule now returns a mutable list, not a tuple, for
    a list-valued attributes. This is an incompatible API change.
  - Roll back change to have native.existing_rules use list instead
    of tuple.
  - BEP includes test suite expansions.
  - config_setting now honors `visibility` attribute (and defaults to
    `//visibility:public`)
  - Change the MultiArchSplitTransitionProvider to be based on
    platform type + CPU instead of fixed "ios_" + cpu.
  - enforce config_setting visibility. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932 for details.
  - add a flag to build v4 signature file
  - Added _direct_source_jars output group to Java related targets.
    END_PUBLIC
  - pkg_deb is no longer part of @bazel_tools//build_defs/pkg:pkg.bzl.
    Use https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_pkg/tree/main/pkg instead
  - Allowing the lipo operations to be conditional in the
    linkMultiArchBinary API for Apple binaries. Single architecture
    slices are now returned through AppleBinaryOutput and the
    Starlark API.
  - Release restriction for "-" in the package name for Python
    sources. Now `py_binary` and `py_test` targets can have main
    source file with "-" in the path.
  - Users consuming BEP may assume that a `named_set_of_files` event
    will
    appear before any event referencing that `named_set` by ID. This
    allows consumers
    to process the files for such events (eg. `TargetCompleted`)
    immediately.
  - BEP includes all files from successful actions in requested
    output groups.
    Previously, an output group's files were excluded if any file in
    the output group
    was not produced due to a failing action. Users can expect BEP
    output to be larger
    for failed builds.
  - In BEP, TargetComplete.output_group has a new field `incomplete`
    indicating that the file_sets field is missing one or more
    declared artifacts
    whose generating actions failed.
  - The flag `--toolchain_resolution_debug` now takes a regex
    argument, which is used to check which toolchain types should
    have debug info printed. You may use `.*` as an argument to keep
    the current behavior of debugging every toolchain type.
  - Add runfiles.merge_all() for merging a sequence of runfiles
    objects.
  - runfiles.merge() and merge_all() now respect
    --nested_set_depth_limit.
    If you hit the depth limit because you were calling merge() in a
    loop, use
    merge_all() on a sequence of runfiles objects instead.
  - Bazel will no longer create a bazel-out symlink if
    --symlink_prefix is specified: the directory pointed to via the
    bazel-out symlink is accessible via ${symlink_prefix}-out. If
    this causes problems for you, set
    --experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink=false in your builds
    and file an issue.
  - Updates worker protocol with cancellation fields, and adds
    experimental_worker_cancellation flag to control cancellation.
  - Simplify build failure output by always using `NNN arguments`.
  - trim_test_configuration now defaults to on
  - Mark genrule.srcs as a source attribute for coverage.
  - When using --allow_analysis_failures (for example, via
    bazel-skylib's
    analysistest with `expect_failure = True`), analysis-time
    failures in aspect
    implementation functions will now be propagated and saved in
    AnalysisFailureInfo, just like analysis-time failures in rules.
  - cquery --noimplicit_deps now correctly filters out resolved
    cc_toolchains
  - Sign apks deterministically.
  - Make gcov optional in cc_toolchain tools.
  - If --experimental_prefer_mutual_xcode is passed, Bazel will
    choose the local default (instead of the newest mutually
    available version) if it's available both locally and remotely.
  - Remove java_lite_proto_library.strict_deps attribute.
  - Generate proguard configurations deterministically.
  - Adds a new flag, `--incompatible_enable_cc_test_feature` which
    switches from the use of build variables to the feature of the
    same name.
  - Dropped fragile xz support from built in pkg_tar. Users requiring
    xz
    compression should switch to bazlebuild/rules_pkg.

Cherry picks:

   + a689d673abadf80f1efaf8ddaeee92d56fc2847b:
     Use getRunfilesPath for run_under executable path generation.
     getRootRelativePath doesn't return a valid runfiles path for
     external source files anymore after the recent external source
     root change. Also, it won't work for external labels either once
     the --nolegacy_external_runfiles becomes default. This fixes
     issue #12545.

```

New features:

  - Starlark-defined flags can now be shorthanded using --flag_alias.

Important changes:

  - Add --starlark:file option. This adds a capability to the
    (cquery)[https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/cquery.html]
    feature in `--output=starlark` mode so that the expression to
    format output may
    be specified in a file.
  - Error messages emitted when an action fails are reworked to be
    more informative about the failing action. Some tooling may have
    to be updated as a result.
  - Querying with output=location now allows the relative_locations
    flag to properly display relative locations instead of the full
    path. Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3497.
  - --flag_alias can now be used without
    --experimental_enable_flag_alias
  - Remove no-op `--deep_execroot` flag
  - The BEP uses `AbortReason.OUT_OF_MEMORY` for abort events when
    the build tool is crashing due to OOM.
  - Added flag `incompatible_display_source_file_location` for `blaze
    query location=output` to print the location of line 1 of the
    actual source files instead of the source file targets. Provides
    a solution to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8900.
  - The Starlark json module is now available.
    Use json.encode(x) to encode a Starlark value as JSON.
    struct.to_json(x) is deprecated and will be disabled by
    the --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods flag.
  - The flag `--incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration` is enabled
    by default.  See #10854.
  - The flag `--incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info` is
    enabled by default.  See #11359.
  - Add `relative_ast_path` feature for darwin builds to relativize
    swiftmodule paths for debugging
  - Use proto.encode_text(x) to encode a Starlark value as textproto.
    struct.to_proto() is deprecated and will be disabled by
    the --incompatible_struct_has_no_methods flag.
    Both functions now reject list/dict fields that contain list/dict
    elements.
  - Add --starlark:file option. This adds a capability to the
    (cquery)[https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/cquery.html]
    feature in `--output=starlark` mode so that the expression to
    format output may be specified in a file.
    See [Configured Query Starlark
    Output](//docs.google.com/document/d/1kL6Tdmp6uLBa9lq_DbUSjIC87glO
    zKIyPoBeF95Rs4c/edit)
  - Flipped --incompatble_proto_output_v2 for aquery.
  - The --incompatible_load_java_rules_from_bzl flag is now a no-op.
  - The --incompatible_load_proto_rules_from_bzl flag is now a no-op.
  - Flipped --incompatible_force_strict_header_check_from_starlark
  - --incompatible_string_replace_count is flipped and removed
    (#11244)
  - Bazel skips incompatible targets based on target platform
    and `target_compatible_with` contents. See
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/platforms.html for more
    details.
  - Bazel returns exit code 36 (rather than 1) if it fails to start a
    subprocess in a local sandbox due to environmental issues, for
    example, if the argument list is too long.
  - //tools/build_defs/pkg:pkg_rpm is no longer built in to Bazel.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11218 for
    instructions
    on how to migrate to the replacement.
  - Javac now supports multiplex workers.
  - The `--default_ios_provisioning_profile` flag has been removed
    (it was a no-op).
  - Add support for using AndroidX dependencies in
    data-binding-enabled targets.
  - Fix data-binding generation for android_local_test.
  - Enable debug_prefix_map_pwd_is_dot feature by default on macOS,
    this passes `-fdebug-prefix-map=$PWD=.` for every compile to
    remove absolute paths from debug info.
  - --incompatible_run_shell_command_string is enabled by default
    (#5903)
  - py_binary now tolerates package paths that contain hyphens ('-').
    Note that such paths might not be importable from within Python
    code.
  - C++ Starlark API requires linker_inputs wrapping library_to_link.
    #10860
  - Toolchain rule is extended with target_settings attribute.
  - --incompatible_restrict_string_escapes=true is now the default.
    Unnecessary backslashes such as "\." in string literals are now
    an error, instead of being silently treated as "\\.".
    To fix the error while preserving behavior, double the backlash.
    However, the error is often a sign that the original code was
    wrong.
  - Propagate instrumented files for transitive sources of
    `android_library` and `android_binary`
  - --local_resources and --incompatible_remove_local_resources have
    been removed. If you've been setting --local resources or
    --incompatible_remove_local_resources=false, you must migrate to
    using --local_ram_resources and --local_cpu_resources instead.
  - Update rules_cc to commit b1c40e1de81913a3c40e5948f78719c28152486d
  - --incompatible_avoid_conflict_dlls=true is now the default.
  - Dynamic execution now uses the new scheduler by default.
  - Dynamic execution now uses the new scheduler by default.
  - The new dynamic scheduler is now the default.

## Release 3.7.0 (2020-10-20)

```
Baseline: a991db7c2f66a354666388d888dcef9b0d0f70c0
```

Incompatible changes:

  - The syntax //foo/BUILD can no longer be used on the command line
    to refer to the //foo:BUILD target. Use //foo:BUILD (preferred)
    or foo/BUILD instead. This does not affect BUILD/bzl files, where
    that syntax already didn't work.
  - This removes `--objc_header_scanner_tool`. The flag was primarily
    used internally, and to our knowledge, a compatible tool was
    never released. Therefore this flag is believed to be unused.

New features:

  - select() directly supports constraint_value (no need for an
    intermediate config_setting).

Important changes:

  - Non-android targets can again be built when
    android_sdk_repository is present but invalid.
  - Add a build variable for -install_name / -soname.
  - Add a build variable for -install_name / -soname.
  - Include "resources" attr in dependency attributes for java_*
    coverage configuration.
  - --trim_test_configuration should work for almost all cases when a
    non-test target depends on a test.
  - Javac now supports multiplex workers.
  - Javac now supports multiplex workers.
  - Blaze now allows symbolic links that point to their own ancestor
    unless they are traversed recursively by e.g. a //... recursive
    target pattern or a recursive glob.
  - Blaze now allows symbolic links that point to their own ancestor

## Release 3.6.0 (2020-10-06)

```
Baseline: aa0d97c0bfc4c09ec6f45303aa80052ba28afbd9

Cherry picks:

   + 32c88da98f301333dc447b75564459165368d418:
     Patch RuleContext for android_binary.deps to restore legacy
     behavior.
   + db9fc88fed387f09067a9250a731f8bf9ad74b05:
     android_test also needs the legacy behavior in
     RuleContext.getPrerequisites.
   + 144d5149a0c50e464dd1be0769fed2ce33ab26a4:
     Update android_sdk_repository to create a valid, but useless,

   + 9f06be482aea3fcadeaf8fca6e48b32f224eba2e:

     Fix issue where libtool_check_unique isn't found for sandbox
     builds
```

Incompatible changes:

  - `--experimental_ui_limit_console_output` is removed. Users of
    `--experimental_ui_limit_console_output=1` for silencing terminal
    output should use `--ui_event_filters=` instead.
  - --proto:instantiation_stack must be enabled in addition to
    --record_rule_instantiation_callstack to see call stack in proto
    output from blaze query.

New features:

  - cc_common.compile support for include_prefix/strip_include_prefix
  - Multiplexed persistent workers: Use
    --experimental_worker_max_multiplex_instances to configure the
    number of WorkRequests that are sent concurrently to one worker
    process. The --worker_max_instances flag will no longer be used
    to determine max instances for multiplex workers, since the two
    have different resource requirements. Multiplex workers will by
    default have a max instances of 8.

Important changes:

  - The prelude file (//tools/build_rules:prelude_bazel) is now
    processed as a Starlark module, rather than being sourced into
    the BUILD file textually. This may cause slight breakages
    depending on the content of the prelude file. (Use of the prelude
    file is discouraged as it will be removed in the long term.)
  - Removed --experimental_ignore_deprecated_instrumentation_spec and
    cleaned up the old deprecated behavior.
  - Added CODEBASE.md, a description of the Bazel codebase.
  - Removed the flag --experimental_transparent_compression.
  - Removed the flag --experimental_action_args.
  - Stop needlessly parsing WORKSPACE files from external
    repositories.
  - Dot ('.') is now allowed in workspace names. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11837.
  - This change can cause memory and performance regressions for some
    builds with C++ dependencies, due to extra actions being executed.
    RELNOTES: None
  - Building Android apps for legacy multi-dex (pre-L) now require a
    main-dex list if the application does not fit into a single DEX
    file.
  - Puts the experimental_worker_multiplex flag to use.
  - In Starlark, the Args object supports a new parameter file format
    'flag_per_line', compatible with the Abseil flags library.
  - The flag --incompatible_no_support_tools_in_action_inputs is
    removed.
  - Support for NDK 21 added
  - Bazel will now skip printing action stdout/stderr contents if
    they exceed --experimental_ui_max_stdouterr_memory_bytes.
  - The Starlark interpreter now correctly emits an error
     if the operand of the first loop in a list comprehension
     refers to a variable bound by a later loop, such as y in
     this example:
       [e1 for x in f(y) in e2 for y in e3] # error: undefined y
                      ^
     This may cause latent dynamic errors to become static errors.
  - Added support for a 'supports-graceful-termination' execution
    requirement and tag, which causes Bazel to send a SIGTERM to any
    tagged
    actions before sending a delayed SIGKILL. This is to give
    actions, and more
    specifically tests, a chance to clean up after themselves.
  - Non-android targets can again be built when
    android_sdk_repository is present but invalid.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - The --experimental_process_wrapper_wait_fix flag (used
    purely to roll out a risky bug fix) has been removed.
  - Removed the --experimental_ui_deduplicate flag.
  - Bazel now correctly prefers Xcode versions in `/Applications`
    over any other paths, which resolves an issue with accidentally
    picking up an Xcode version from a Time Machine backup or network
    disk. In the improbable case that you relied on the old behavior
    and Bazel now picks up Xcode from the wrong location, you can fix
    it by moving that Xcode version to /Applications.

New features:

  - cquery now follows aspects with --include_aspects.
  - cc_common.compile support for include_prefix/strip_include_prefix

Important changes:

  - Add support to bazel/crosstool for building arm64 on macos aka
    darwin
  - Add opt in 'oso_prefix_is_pwd' feature for Apple builds
  - Add InstrumentedFilesInfo provider to Starlark globals.
  - Fixed resource shrinking when <overlayable/> tags are used.
  - Remove old incompatible flag
    --incompatible_symlinked_sandbox_expands_tree_artifacts_in_runfile
    s_tree.
  - Update coverage configuration for Python, filegroup, and shell
    script rules to distinguish between source and dependency
    attributes.
  - Add support to bazel/crosstool for building arm64e on macos aka
    darwin
  - Make filegroup always forward InstrumentedFilesProvider and not
    collect any sources directly.
  - Support signing key rotation in android_binary
  - Remove legacy handling of --extra_checks
  - Support signing key rotation in android_binary
    GO...
  - `--apple_bitcode` now takes an optional platform and only applies
    the Bitcode mode to that platform if present. The option may be
    provided multiple times.
  - Support signing key rotation in android_binary
  - NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS is now passed for all Apple architectures.
  - Major changes to reporting of Starlark errors and the call stack.
    (Please be alert to possible regressions, such as errors that
    lack relevant location information.)
  - Removed the flag --experimental_transparent_compression.
  - Removed the flag --experimental_action_args.
  - Stop needlessly parsing WORKSPACE files from external
    repositories.
  - Dot ('.') is now allowed in workspace names. See

     fixup! Gracefully handle the lack of subreaper support in Linux.
```

Incompatible changes:

  - This removes the short-lived --process_wrapper_extra_flags
    flag, which was introduced primarily to roll out a bug fix.
    Unfortunately,
    this made us inadvertently expose all of the process-wrapper's
    command line
    interface to the public, which should not have happened.  Given
    the corner
    case of the utility of this flag, the lack of documentation for
    it, and the
    fact that it only appeared in a single release, we are treating
    this as a
    bug instead of a backwards compatibility breakage.

New features:

  - bazel info: Allow to specify multiple keys.
  - Support code coverage with GCC 9.

Important changes:

  - Allow InstrumentedFilesInfo fields to be read from Starlark.
  - The --starlark_cpu_profile=<file> flag writes a profile in
    pprof format containing a statistical summary of CPU usage
    by all Starlark execution during the bazel command. Use it
    to identify slow Starlark functions in loading and analysis.
  - The --debug_depset_flag has been removed as it is in effect
    always on at no cost.
  - Rule authors should use the
    incompatible_use_toolchain_transition rule attribute to migrate
    to using
    the toolchain transition. jcater to udpate notes further.
  - `apple_binary` rules now accept the `stamp` attribute with the
    same
    semantics that it has in `cc_binary` rules.
  - --incompatible_objc_provider_remove_compile_info turns off
    the compile info/mege_zip Starlark APIs in ObjcProvider.  See
    #11359.
  - The --debug_depset_flag has been removed as it is in effect
    always on at no cost.
  - Fix behavior of ctx.actions.write so content is written without
    an incorrect encoding to UTF-8.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10174 for details.
  - Collect more performance metrics for worker execution.
  - Add flag --incompatible_force_strict_header_check_from_starlark
  - Configure coverage and runfiles for sh_library.
  - Adds --incompatible_blacklisted_protos_requires_proto_info to
    indicate whether proto_lang_toolchain.blacklisted_protos requires
    ProtoInfo.

Incompatible changes:

  - The startup option --fatal_event_bus_exceptions is now a no-op
    and will be removed soon.

New features:

  - Bazel offers basic completion for the fish shell.

Important changes:

  - Add configuration_field for --custom_malloc to cpp config fragment
  - Flip --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration to true.  See
    #10854.
  - It is now possible to use different action mnemonics while still
    sharing the same pool of persistent workers. It requires setting
    a new property
    on the execution requirements (`worker-key-mnemonic`). The value
    overrides
    the action's mnemonic when it comes to reusing worker processes.
  - linkshared=1 in cc_binary no longer requires '.so' or '.dll' in
    the target name
  - Revert --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration to false.  See
    #10854.
  - Invoke clang with the correct -target flag when building for
    watchOS.
  - NA
  - Add experiment flag to forward InstrumentedFilesInfo from
    non-tool deps by default.

```
Baseline: 1d93d26d9900328dcba0026bf21cb45cc37a4596
```

Important changes:

  - Renamed --experimental_slim_json_profile to --slim_profile.
  - Expose ctx.attr.write Args content for analysistest when possible
  - Added aquery_differ_v2 that works with the new aquery proto
    output format.
  - Add new flag, 'experimental_no_product_name_out_symlink', to omit
    creating '<product>-out' symlink if user specifies
    '--symlink_prefix' option.
  - --ram_utilization_factor is removed (as is
    --incompatible_remove_ram_utilization_factor). Please use
    --local_ram_resources.
  - Improve include scanner support for cl.exe and clang-cl command
    lines
  - ctx.split_attr now includes attributes with Starlark split
    transitions.
  - Added --incompatible_string_replace_count, to make
    string.replace() behave as in Python.
  - Bazel can now recursively delete non-executable but readable
    directories.
  - Restore case-sensitivity to -I and /I include scanning detection
    to avoid conflicts.

    rotobuf which has been flipped in Bazel 3.0.
  - Allow assembly file sources in cc_common.compile.
  - Set default .netrc file on Windows to %USERPROFILE%
  - A maximum 150 attributes per RuleClass is enforced
  - Increase max targets per rule class limit to 200
  - ctx.split_attr now includes attributes with Starlark split
    transitions.
  - The --max_computation_steps flag bounds the computation done by a
    BUILD file.
  - Native patch can handle file permission properly
  - Aspects may now propagate through dependencies on rule outputs by
    being defined with `apply_to_generating_rules = True`.
  - 'query --output=build' now shows where rule classes (not just
    rules) are created.
  - The flag `incompatible_bzl_disallow_load_after_statement` is
    removed.
  - ctx.split_attr now includes attributes with Starlark split

  - The flag `--incompatible_depset_union` is removed.
  - Bazel uses fewer compiler flags by default when building
    Objective-C. In
    particular, Bazel no longer sets `-O0`, `-DDEBUG=1`,
    `-fstack-protector`, `-fstack-protector-all`, or `-g` in dbg
    mode, and
    Bazel no longer sets `-Os`, `-DNDEBUG=1`, `-Wno-unused-variable`,
    `-Winit-self`, or `-Wno-extra` in opt mode. If you want to apply
    these
    flags to your project, you can reenable them in your CROSSTOOL.
  - A maximum attribute name length is 128 is enforced

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Flip --incompatible_remove_enabled_toolchain_types, so that rules
    can no longer access enabled toolchain types from the platform
    fragment.
  - The --incompatible_use_jdk11_as_host_javabase flag has been
    removed (it was flipped in Bazel 0.25.0).
  - Using JDK 9 or 10 as a `--host_javabase` is no longer officially
    supported. As always, you can use the
    `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_vanilla` Java toolchain to use
    older or newer JDKs than what Bazel currently supports.
  - --fatal_event_bus_exceptions is deprecated and should not be
    used. Any crashes should be reported so that they can be fixed.
  - The old-style binary profile format is no longer suppported, use
    the new JSON trace profile instead.

Important changes:

  - Improve the performance of creating a sandboxed execution root
    for workers when the number of inputs is large (>1000).
  - Treat .cu and .cl files as C++ source. CUDA or OpenCL are not
    natively supported and will require custom flags to compile with
    e.g. clang.
  - Add actions' primary output details in JSON profile and
    analysis_v2.proto.
  - Add --cds_archive option for embedding CDS archive into deploy
    JAR.
  - Add new global attribute: applicable_licenses
    - Package level default with default_applicable_licenses
    - guarded by --incompatible_applicable_licenses (default true for
    Blaze, false for Bazel)
    - In support of
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uwBuhAoBNrw8tmFs-NxlssI6VRolid
    GYdYqagLqHWt8/edit#
  - Non-test Java rules no longer require the TestConfiguration and
    thus --trim_test_configuration is again usable for Java builds
  - The flag `--incompatible_always_check_depset_elements` is enabled
    by default.
  - --incompatible_objc_compile_info_migration determines
    whether native rules can assume compile info has been migrated to
    CcInfo. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10854.
  - --incompatible_remove_local_resources is true by default. Please
    use --local_ram_resources and --local_cpu_resources instead of
    --local_resources.

## Release 2.2.0 (2020-03-03)

```
Baseline: 78055efad0917b848078bf8d97b3adfddf91128d
```

Incompatible changes:

  - The --[no]incompatible_windows_bashless_run_command flag is no
    longer supported. It was flipped in Bazel 1.0
  - The --[no]incompatible_windows_native_test_wrapper flag is no
    longer supported. It was flipped in Bazel 1.0

Important changes:

  - Consistent target naming style in example target names.
  - cquery's config() now supports arbitrary configurations.
  - The flag --incompatible_disallow_dict_lookup_unhashable_keys is
    removed.
  - Include target label in Python version error message.
  - The flag --incompatible_remap_main_repo is removed.
  - Windows: we now discourage running Bazel from MSYS2 because of a
    newly found bug (#10573)
  - Reduced the packaging time (`package-bazel.sh`) for the
    `//src:bazel-dev` Bazel development build target from 14s to 6s.
    Use `//src:bazel-dev` if you're iterating rapidly on a local
    Bazel changes, and use `//src:bazel --compilation_mode=opt` for
    release builds.
  - cquery: "//foo:bar" now means "all configured targets with label
    //foo:bar" instead of "choose an arbitrary configured target with
    label //foo:bar". See cquery docs for details.
  - WORKSPACE and BUILD.bazel files of http_archive repositories can
    now be patched using the "patch_cmds" and "patches" attributes.
  - Actions with "parse" on the critical path should no longer finish
    in the future.
  - Flags that affect external repositories like
    "--override_repository" can now be addressed in bazelrc files
    using the "common" command, without causing commands like "bazel
    shutdown" to fail.
  - The flag --incompatible_disallow_unverified_http_downloads is
    removed.
  - Create the incompatibleApplicableLicenses flag.
    We plan to flip this from false to true in Bazel 4.x.
    Implementation to follow.
  - Treat .cu and .cl files as C++ source. CUDA or OpenCL are not
    natively supported and will require custom flags to compile with
    e.g. clang.
  - Treat .cu and .cl files as C++ source. CUDA or OpenCL are not
    natively supported and will require custom flags to compile with
    e.g. clang.
  - The --starlark_cpu_profile=<file> flag writes a profile in
    pprof format containing a statistical summary of CPU usage
    by all Starlark execution during the bazel command. Use it
    to identify slow Starlark functions in loading and analysis.
  - --ram_utilization_factor will be deprecated. Please use
    --local_ram_resources=HOST_RAM*<float>
  - Docs: glob() documentation is rewritten, and now it points out a
    pitfall of rules shadowing glob-matched files.

## Release 2.1.0 (2020-02-07)

```
Baseline: 41ec5a28fb30a8d6c5c60194c4bb29528352cf78

Cherry picks:

   + 733ac0ff7ad1e13ab68ceb2fde694d7ab71b2366:
     Adds an alias for d8_jar_import in android.WORKSPACE.
   + c94b1474b368dedf9f68f34fad90cc8664f2b0e0:
     Automatic code cleanup.
   + 2a8cc7075f741721563efd9dc050ca3458cde30b:
     Do not fail or print errors when Shellzelisk cannot find a
     requested ?
   + bdf34d7fd9539411e93348ba25307f34362d9a42:
     Fix race when extracting the install base when Bazel runs in a
     PID namespace.
   + d381c25bb7dd205c283f7ad91cac13190d2dfede:
     Fix wrong mode of install base directory.
   + eab39cc7b5a612f891fd1e5af5b45bdc1b66e6e1:
     Disable broken test_max_open_file_descriptors.
```

Incompatible changes:

  - The following attributes of CcToolchainProvider, which formerly
    were
    accessible both as fields (x.f) and as methods (x.f()), are now
    only fields:

New features:

  - Similar to the
    [.bazelignore](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/guide.html
    #.bazelignore) in the main repository, a `.bazelignore` file in
    external repository will cause the specified directories to be
    ignored by Bazel. Bazel won't try to identify any packages under
    the directories, but the files can still be referenced in other
    BUILD files.
  - bazelignore files now support line comments, e.g. "# this is a
    comment"

Important changes:

  - Experimental support for d8 merger is now available for use using
    --define=android_dexmerger_tool=d8_dexmerger.
  - Critical path run time should not have a longer run time than
    total execution run time.
  - Remove "please do not import" warning for cc rules.
  - x.f() is now equivalent to y=x.f; y(). That is, x.f should return
    the same
    attribute value regardless of whether it is accessed as a field
    or called
    like a method. Any arguments to the call are evaluated after the
    x.f operation.
  - Add desugaring support for RoleManager#addRoleHolderAsUser
  - Adds ctx.target_platform_has_constraint to allow rules to check
    the target platform's constraints.
  - Critical path run time should not have a longer run time than
    total execution run time.
  - Post new ConvenienceSymlinksIdentifiedEvent to the
    BuildEventProtocol when
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event is enabled.
  - Keyword-only arguments are now allowed:
        def foo(a, *, k): pass
        def foo(a, *b, k): pass
      where k can be specified only by keyword:
        foo(5, k=6)
  - Generated Go protobufs now depend on //net/proto2/go:protodeps in
    addition to //net/proto2/go:proto
  - cquery 'somepath' returns more reliable results when the
    dep has a different configuration than the parent. To get a
    result for
    `somepath(//foo, //bar`) where //bar isn't in the top-level
    configuration,
    run your query with `--universe_scope=//foo`. See cquery docs for
    details.

## Release 2.0.0 (2019-12-19)

```
Baseline: 807ed23e4f53a5e008ec823e9c23e2c9baa36d0d

Cherry picks:

   + db0e32ca6296e56e5314993fe9939bc7331768ec:
     build.sh: Fix bug in build script for RC release
   + 85e84f7812f04bc0dbc36376f31b6dd2d229b905:
     Set --incompatible_prohibit_aapt1 default to true.
   + 84eae2ff550c433a3d0409cf2b5525059939439d:
     Let shellzelisk fallback to bazel-real if it's the requested
     version.
   + d5ae460f1581ddf27514b4be18255481b47b4075:
     Fix a typo in bazel.sh
```

Incompatible changes:

  - --incompatible_remap_main_repo is enabled by default. Therefore,
    both ways of addressing the main repository, by its name and by
    '@' are now considered referring to the same repository.
    see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7130
  - --incompatible_disallow_dict_lookup_unhashable_keys is enabled by
    default https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9184
  - --incompatible_remove_native_maven_jar is now enabled by default
    and the flag removed. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6799
  - --incompatible_prohibit_aapt1 is enabled by default.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10000

Important changes:

  - --incompatible_proto_output_v2: proto v2 for aquery proto output
    formats, which reduces the output size compared to v1. Note that
    the messages' ids in v2 are in uint64 instead of string like in
    v1.
  - Adds --incompatible_remove_enabled_toolchain_types.
  - Package loading now consistently fails if package loading had a
    glob evaluation that encountered a symlink cycle or symlink
    infinite expansion. Previously, such package loading with such
    glob evaluations would fail only in some cases.
  - The --disk_cache flag can now also be used together
    with the gRPC remote cache.
  - An action's discover inputs runtime metrics is now categorized as
    parse time on the CriticalPathComponent.
  - Make the formatting example more like to the written text by
    adding an initial description.
  - An action's discover inputs runtime metrics is now categorized as
    parse time on the CriticalPathComponent.
  - Bazel's Debian package and the binary installer now include an
    improved wrapper that understands `<WORKSPACE>/.bazelversion`
    files and the `$USE_BAZEL_VERSION` environment variable. This is
    similar to what Bazelisk offers
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk#how-does-bazelisk-know-whi
    ch-bazel-version-to-run-and-where-to-get-it-from), except that it
    works offline and integrates with apt-get.
  - We are planning to deprecate the runfiles manifest files, which
    aren't safe in the presence of whitespace, and also unnecessarily
    require local CPU when remote execution is used. This release
    adds --experimental_skip_runfiles_manifests to disable the
    generation of the input manifests (rule.manifest files) in most
    cases. Note that this flag has no effect on Windows by default or
    if --experimental_enable_runfiles is explicitly set to false.

## Release 1.2.1 (2019-11-26)

```
Baseline: 11deef7582dfeec7a04ee3f7236393d9b8027367

Cherry picks:

   + c76c3e539c73ecf6e96e3e098be7be59e17bf276:
     Replace macOS CC path with relative path
   + 63332eb556fadfe9edd0806add79942482adddef:
     Hardcode path to dirname on macOS
   + ceadf0a063cb97c32aced143d2447781d1dafc38:

   + dbe63b00954a25fa4405f7cbf273df78c16498dd:
     Fix some of the bazel Windows tools code to work with GCC.
```

This release fixes a single regression:
- #10297: Bazel 1.2.0 does no longer run on macOS High Sierra.

It is the same code as Bazel 1.2.0, except that we rebuild the macOS release
binaries with Xcode 10.2.1 to make them backwards compatible with older macOS
versions again.

## Release 1.2.0 (2019-11-20)

```
Baseline: 11deef7582dfeec7a04ee3f7236393d9b8027367

   + dbe63b00954a25fa4405f7cbf273df78c16498dd:
     Fix some of the bazel Windows tools code to work with GCC.
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Tree artifacts and regular artifact paths can no longer overlap.

New features:

  - Added a special "_validation" output group to enable moving
    "validation actions" off the critical path of builds.

Important changes:

  - The query flag "--host_deps" (commonly used as "--nohost_deps")
    has been renamed to "--tool_deps", and now also removes
    dependencies in any execution configuration from being reported
    in the query output. The previous flag name is deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release.
  - The `cc_common.{compile,link}` APIs can now be used without
    passing the `--experimental_cc_skylark_api_enabled_packages` flag.
  - A list of log paths will be provided in build output.
  - Improve runfiles documentation.
  - Improve documentation on rule outputs.
  - BUILD/.bzl execution errors cause execution to stop, even at
    top-level
  - Multiple Starlark validation errors are reported in a single pass.
  - Introduce --experimental_nested_set_as_skykey_threshold
  - Blaze will prevent idle sleep during test and build actions. Note
    that this does not affect screen savers and will not keep a
    laptop awake if the user forces sleep or closes the lid. This is
    purely to avoid idle sleeping when the user is not interacting
    with the device.
  - Improve testing docs.
  - Incompatible flag
    `--incompatible_validate_top_level_header_inclusions` has been
    added. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10047 for
    details.
  - Fix an aquery bug with handling malformed queries that crashes
    bazel.
  - List fields on CcLinkingOutputs.
  - [Python] Added flag --incomaptible_default_to_explicit_init_py to
    switch the default value of legacy_create_init to True. With this
    flag enabled, your py_binary and py_test targets will no longer
    behave as if empty __init__.py files were implicitly littered in
    your runfiles tree. See
    [#10076](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10076).
  - Fix documentation on allowed target names.
  - --target_platform_fallback now also applies to exec/host
    configurations
  - android_binary and android_libary can now depend on targets
    providing
    CcInfos.
  - Add support for tracking suspensions (sleeps or SIGSTOP) on macOS.
  - d8 dexers (both standalone and incremental) are now available for
    use.
  - Add Desugar support for FreezePeriod#<init>

Incompatible changes:

  - Python, Windows: the
    --[no]incompatible_windows_escape_python_args is no longer
    supported. (It was flipped to true in Bazel 0.27.0)
  - --incompatible_use_native_patch is enabled by default
  - Windows: --incompatible_windows_bashless_run_command is now true
    by default, meaning "bazel run //foo:bin" will run the binary as
    a subprocess of the Bazel client. (When the flag is false, the
    binary is executed as a subprocess of Bash.)
  - Windows: --incompatible_windows_native_test_wrapper is enabled by
    default

New features:

  - Genrule now supports `cmd_bash`, `cmd_ps`, `cmd_bat` attributes.
    More details at
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule.c
    md
  - config_setting can now check multiple values on "--foo=firstVal
    --foo=secondVal ..."-style flags
  - tags: use `--experimental_allow_tags_propagation` flag to
    propagate tags to the action's execution requirements from
    targets. Such tags should start with: `no-`, `requires-`,
    `supports-`, `block-`, `disable-`, `cpu:`. See #8830 for details.
  - Users can now get generated def file from cc_library via
    "def_file" output group on Windows.
  - Platform-specific bazelrc: with --enable_platform_specific_config
    you can
    enable flags in bazelrc according to your host platform.
  - tags: use `--experimental_allow_tags_propagation` flag to
    propagate tags to the action's execution requirements from
    cc_library or cc_binary targets. Such tags should start with:
    `no-`, `requires-`, `supports-`, `block-`, `disable-`, `cpu:`.
    See #8830 for details.
  - tags: use --experimental_allow_tags_propagation flag to propagate
    tags to the action's execution requirements from java targets.
    Such tags should start with: no-, requires-, supports-, block-,
    disable-, cpu:. See #8830 for details.

Important changes:

  - Bazel Android builds now use aapt2 by default. To revert to aapt,
    set `--android_aapt=aapt`.
  - Make either --subcommands or --verbose_failures imply
    --materialize_param_files
  - Bazel Android builds now use aapt2 by default. To revert to aapt,
    set `--an...
    RELNOTES: None
  - by default all remote connections considered to be via `gRPC`
    with TLS enabled, unless other specified. To disable TLS use
    `grpc://` prefix for you endpoints. All remote connections via
    `gRPC` affected - `--remote_cache`, `--remote_executor` or
    `--bes_backend`. http cache/executor is not affected. See #8061
    for details.
  - cc_* rules support non-transitive defines through a
    'local_defines' attribute.
  - Enable
    incompatible_disallow_rule_execution_platform_constraints_allowed
    by default (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8136).
  - incompatible_disallow_split_empty_separator is enabled by default

    issue](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9102) for more
    information.
  - --incompatible_disable_static_cc_toolchains has been flipped. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8546.
  - --remote_default_platform_properties has been deprecated in favor
    of --remote_default_exec_properties.
  - The --incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone flag has
    been flipped, see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6791
    for more information.
  - The --incompatible_use_specific_tool_files flag has been flipped.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/9126 for more
    information.
  - Clarify default visibility.
  - Enables incompatible_auto_configure_host_platform
  - New incompatible flag --incompatible_disable_depset_items
    disables the "items" parameter in the Starlark depset
    constructor. Use "direct" and "transitive" parameters instead.
  - --incompatible_assignment_identifiers_have_local_scope is enabled
  - incompatible_disable_partition_default_parameter is enabled by
    default ()
  - incompatible_restrict_attribute_names is enabled
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6437)
  - The --incompatible_disable_nocopts flag has been flipped. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8546 for more

  - Deprecated Java-Starlark API java_common.create_provider is
    removed. JavaInfo() legacy args (actions, sources, source_jars,
    use_ijar, java_toolchain, host_javabase) are removed.
  - The flag incompatible_disallow_hashing_frozen_mutables is enabled
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7800)
  - `maven_jar` and `maven_server` now disallow using plain HTTP URLs
    without a specified checksum. If you are still using `maven_jar`,
    consider migrating to
    [`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_ext
    ernal) for transitive dependency management. See
    [#8607](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8607) for more
    information.
  - Added `sha256` and `sha256_src` attributes to `maven_jar`. Please
    consider migrating to SHA-256 as SHA-1 has been deemed
    cryptographically insecure ([https://shattered.io]()). Or, use
    [`rules_jvm_external`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_ext
    ernal) to manage your transitive Maven dependencies with artifact
    pinning and SHA-256 verification support.
  - introducing per-target exec_properties
  - Bazel now supports ThinLTO builds on Linux for Clang versions >=
    6.0. ThinLTO can be enabled through --features=thin_lto
  - The Target.output_group field in Starlark is removed. Use
    OutputGroupInfo instead. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7949 for details.
  - Make a number of parameters of Starlark builtin functions
    positional-only (as opposed to specifiable by keyword). See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8147 for details.
  - incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink is enabled by default (#8651)
  - Change Pruned events will fire immediately after being checked.
  - --incompatible_remove_legacy_whole_archive has been flipped. See

```

Important changes:

  - rule_test: fix Bazel 0.27 regression ("tags" attribute was
    ingored, https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8723
  - Adds --incompatible_enable_execution_transition, which enables
    incremental migration of host attributes to exec attributes.
  - objc_proto_library rule has been deleted from Bazel.
  - repository_ctx.read is no longer restricted to files
        in the repository contructed.
  - tags 'no-remote', 'no-cache', 'no-remote-cache',
    'no-remote-exec', 'no-sandbox' are propagated now to the actions
    from targets when '--ncompatible_allow_tags_propagation' flag set
    to true. See #8830.
  - Adds flag
    --//tools/build_defs/pkg:incompatible_no_build_defs_pkg. This
    flag turns off the rules //tools/build_defs/pkg:{pkg_deb,
    pkg_rpm, pkg_tar}.
  - The Android NDK is now integrated with toolchains. To use them,
    pass the `--extra_toolchains=@androidndk//:all` flag or register
    them in your WORKSPACE with
    `register_toolchains("@androidndk//:all")`.
  - Stdout and stderr are checked to determine if output is going to a
    terminal. `--is_stderr_atty` is deprecated and `--isatty` is
    undeprecated.
  - --incompatible_load_proto_rules_from_bzl was added to forbid
    loading the native proto rules directly. See more on tracking
    issue #8922
  - Docker Sandbox now respects remote_default_platform_properties
  - pkg_deb, pkg_rpm & pkg_tar deprecation plan announced in the
    documentation.
  - The new java_tools release:
    * fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8614
    * exposes a new toolchain `@java_tools//:prebuilt_toolchain`
    which is using all the pre-built tools, including singlejar and
    ijar, even on remote execution. This toolchain should be used
    only when host and execution platform are the same, otherwise the
    binaries will not work on the execution platform.
  - java_common.compile supports specifying
    annotation_processor_additional_inputs and
    annotation_processor_additional_outputs for the Java compilation
    action for supporting annotation processors that consume or
    produce artifacts. Fixes #6415
  - There is now documentation on optimizing Android app build
    performance. Read it at
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.29.0/android-build-performance
    .html
  - Execution log now respects --remote_default_platform_properties
  - Include a link to the relevant documenation on transitive Python
    version errors.
  - New incompatible flag
    --incompatible_disable_target_provider_fields removes the ability
    (in Starlark) to access a target's providers via the field syntax
    (for example, `ctx.attr.dep.my_provider`). The provider-key
    syntax should be used instead (for example,
    `ctx.attr.dep[MyProvider]`). See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9014 for details.
  - A new platform exec_properties is added to replace
    remote_execution_properties.
  - Added --incompatible_load_python_rules_from_bzl, which will be
    flipped in Bazel 1.0. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/9006.
  - add --break_build_on_parallel_dex2oat_failure to shortcut tests
    on dex2oat errors

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Add --incompatible_enable_profile_by_default to enable the JSON
    profile by default.
  - The --incompatible_windows_style_arg_escaping flag is flipped to
    "true", and the "false" case unsupported. Bazel no longer accepts
    this flag.

Important changes:

  - Bazel now supports hiding compiler warnings for targets that
    you're not explicitly building (see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#flag--au
    to_output_filter).
  - Flag `--incompatible_restrict_escape_sequences` is added. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8380
  - The "info" command now supports the "starlark-semantics"
    argument, which outputs a representation of the effective Starlark
    semantics option values.
  - The `outputs` parameter of the `rule()` function is deprecated
    and attached to flag `--incompatible_no_rule_outputs_param`.
    Migrate rules to use `OutputGroupInfo` or `attr.output` instead.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7977 for more info.
  - When `--incompatible_strict_action_env` is enabled, the default
    `PATH` now includes `/usr/local/bin`.
  - Turn on --experimental_build_setting_api by default for starlark
    build settings (see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/config.html#user-
    defined-build-settings for more info)
  - `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_java10` and
    `@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_java11` are now available to
    enable java 10, respectively java 11 language level support.
  - The `command` parameter of the `actions.run_shell()` function
    will be restricted to only accept strings (and not string
    sequences). This check is attached to flag
    `--incompatible_run_shell_command_string`. One may migrate by
    using the `arguments` parameter of `actions.run()` instead. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5903 for more info.
  - Incompatible change
    `--incompatible_use_platforms_repo_for_constraints` has been
    added. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8622 for
    details.
  - Incompatible change
    `--incompatible_use_platforms_repo_for_constraints` has been
    added. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8622 f...
  - Bazel's C++ autoconfiguration now understands `BAZEL_LINKLIBS`
    environment variable to specify system libraries that should be
    appended to the link command line.
  - paths under the execution root starting with "." or "_" will be
    re-linked across builds
  - execution_log_json_file now allows actions without outputs.
  - Labels aapt as deprecated for aapt_version, and heavily endorses
    aapt2.
  - Update doc links still pointing to cc_binary.features to point to
    common features
  - Incompatible change
    `--incompatible_use_platforms_repo_for_constraints` has been
    added. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8622 for

```

Incompatible changes:

  - --incompatible_disable_objc_provider_resources no longer has
    effect. Use of deprecated resource fields on the Objc provider is
    now disallowed regardless of this flag.
  - deleted deprecated --experimental-remote-retry* flags, please use
    --remote_retries instead
  - flipped --incompatible_list_based_execution_strategy_selection
    flag to be true by default. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7480 for details.
  - Octal integer literals in Starlark are required to start with
    "Oo".
  - The "native" module is no longer available in BUILD files, all
    its members can be accessed directly as global symbols. This can
    be temporarily reverted by providing
    --incompatible_disallow_native_in_build_file=false as a flag to
    Blaze.

  - cleanup that affects user provided apple frameworks is
    now enabled by default.  See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7944 for more info.
  - Python rules now determine the Python runtime using toolchains
    rather than `--python_top` and `--python_path`, which are
    deprecated. See
    [#7899](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7899) for
    information on declaring Python toolchains and migrating your
    code. As a side-benefit, this addresses
    [#4815](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4815)
    (incorrect interpreter version used) on non-Windows platforms.
    Note however that some builds break due to getting the version
    they asked for -- consider setting `python_version = "PY2"` on
    Python 2 targets and `--host_force_python=PY2` if any Python 2
    targets are used in the host configuration. You can temporarily
    opt out of this change with
    `--incompatible_use_python_toolchains=false`.
  - Depsets can't be iterated over unless they're converted to lists
    using the .to_list() method. Use
    --incompatible_depset_is_not_iterable=false to
    temporarily restore the previous behaviour.

New features:

  - Bash, runfiles: the copy-pasted init code of the Bash runfiles
    library is now shorter, see `tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash`.
    The rlocation() implementation is the same.
  - Bash, runfiles: the copy-pasted init code of the Bash runfiles
    library is now shorter, see `tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash`.
    The rlocation() implementation is the same.
  - Bash, runfiles: the copy-pasted init code of the Bash runfiles
    library is now shorter, see `tools/bash/runfiles/runfiles.bash`.
    To use the new init code, you need Bazel 0.27 or newer. The old
    (longer) init code still works.

Important changes:

  - The `outputs` parameter of the `rule()` function is deprecated
    and attached to flag `--incompatible_no_rule_outputs_param`.
    Migrate rules to use `OutputGroupInfo` or `attr.output` instead.
    See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7977 for more info.
  - The --incompatible_disable_objc_library_resources flag is being
    removed. Please remove it from your configs as it otherwise will
    fail the build.
  - Add a generic additional_linker_inputs attribute on cc_binary
    rules.
  - Windows, C++ autoconfigure: BAZEL_VC and BAZEL_VS may now have
    quotes, so if you set these envvars' values in cmd.exe via
    TAB-completion then you no longer need to remove the surrounding
    quotes.
  - pkg_deb has new attributes: `config` and `templates` that can be
    used for integration with debconf
  - Allow cc_import() of a DLL with no interface library on Windows,
    used to document runtime dependencies.
  - All host-configured Python tools that are built for the wrong
    Python version will now emit a warning message when they exit
    with non-zero status. See #7899.
  - deprecated --remote_local_fallback_strategy. Use
    `--strategy=remote,local` instead. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7480.
  - Introduce --incompatible_disable_native_android_rules flag
  - The Android desugaring actions now support a persistent worker
    mode for faster local build performance. Enable it with
    `--strategy=Desugar=worker`.
  - --incompatible_static_name_resolution_in_build_files is now
    enabled by default
  - --incompatible_disable_deprecated_attr_params is now enabled by
    default (#5818)
  - Repository containing autoconfigured C++ toolchain
    `@local_config_cc` has been split in 2 - see
    `local_config_cc_toolchains`.
  - --incompatible_string_join_requires_strings is now enabled by
    default
  - Flag --incompatible_new_actions_api is enabled by dewfault (#5825)
  - New flag `--incompatible_disallow_empty_glob`. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8195
  - --incompatible_no_kwargs_in_build_files is enabled by default
  - Incompatible flag
    `--incompatible_require_ctx_in_configure_features` has been
    flipped. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7793 for
    more information.
  - `BAZEL_USE_XCODE_TOOLCHAIN=1` tells Bazel not to look for Xcode to
    decide whether to enable toolchains for Apple rules, but to
    assume Xcode is
    available. Can be also used when building on Darwin and no C++ or
    ObjC is being
    built, so there is no need to detect Xcode.
  - Android desugaring actions now use persistent workers by default.
    This has been measured to provide up to 20% reduction in build
    times. To disable it, use the `--strategy=Desugar=sandboxed`
    flag. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8342 and
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8427 for more details
    on local build speed optimization for Android apps.
  - Fixed an issue with Android builds where `--fat_apk_cpu` doesn't
    pack all selected shared libraries from `aar_import` targets into
    the APK. See
    [#8283](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8283).
  - Turn on --experimental_starlark_config_transitions by default for
    starlark transitions (see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/config.html#user-
    defined-transitions for more info)
  - Turn on --experimental_build_setting_api by default for starlark
    build settings (see

### Incompatible changes

- [`--incompatible_windows_escape_jvm_flags`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7486)
  is enabled by default, and removed.

- [`--incompatible_windows_style_arg_escaping`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7454)
  is enabled by default.

- [`--incompatible_no_output_attr_default`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7950)
  is enabled by default.

- [`--incompatible_depset_union`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5817)
  is enabled by default.

- [`--incompatible_disable_genrule_cc_toolchain_dependency`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6867) removed

- [`--Incompatible_disallow_rule_execution_platform_constraints_allowed`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8136):
  When enabled, disallows the use of the `execution_platform_constraints_allowed`
  attribute when defining new rules.

- [`--incompatible_disable_objc_provider_resources`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5710)
  is now enabled by default.

### Apple

- The `--ios_multi_cpus`, `--watchos_cpus`, `--macos_cpus` and `--tvos_cpus` are
  now additive. This means that you can now split the `--ios_multi_cpus=arm64,armv7`
  into `--ios_multi_cpus=arm64` and `--ios_multi_cpus=armv7`.

- Add `--incompatible_objc_framework_cleanup` to control whether to enable some
  objc framework cleanup that changes the API. Specifically, the cleanup changes
  the objc provider API pertaining to frameworks. This change is expected to be
  transparent to most users unless they write their own Starlark rules to handle
  frameworks. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7594 for details.

- `objc_library` does not support resource attributes any more. Please read
  [#7594](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7594) for more info.

### Android

- Android resource conflicts will no longer be reported between a strong attr
  resource and a weak attr resource, if the weak attr does not have format
  specified.

### C++

- [Allow debugging C++ features logic](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/53156db1e30fe7197889c3cbc8d1321ff9b85143

- Add new options [`--cs_fdo_instrument`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--cs_fdo_instrument)
  and [`--cs_fdo_profile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#flag--cs_fdo_profile)
  to support LLVM's context-sensitive FDO (CSFDO).

- [Bazel C++ compile/link Starlark API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4570).
  Can be used with experimental flag `--experimental_cc_skylark_api_enabled_packages`.

- `cc_toolchain.static_runtime_lib` and `cc_toolchain.dynamic_runtime_lib` are
  now exposed to Starlark.

- C++ Starlark API for compilation and linking is no longer whitelisted

- Incompatible flag `--incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone` has
  been added. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6791 for details.

- Feature `disable_whole_archive_for_static_lib` has been added to allow turning
  off legacy_whole_archive for individual targets.
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7362

### Python

- Fixed an issue where some `py_runtimes` were incompatible with using
  `--build_python_zip` ([#5104](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5104)).

### Starlark

- The flag [`--incompatible_restrict_named_params`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8147)
  is added. [Buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools) will soon be
  updated to automatically fix this in your code.

- The flag [`--incompatible_no_kwargs_in_build_files`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8021)
  is added. It fixes a bug where the `**kwarg` notation was allowed in `BUILD`
  files.

- The flag [`--incompatible_static_name_resolution_in_build_files`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8022)
  is added. This fixes a bug where invalid code was silently accepted.

- The flag [`--incompatible_disallow_old_octal_notation`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8059)
  is added. It removes a deprecated notation for octal numbers.
  [Buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools) can update your code
  automatically.

- [`struct.to_proto()`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/struct.html#to_proto)
  can now convert dictionaries into proto3 text message.

- The [`glob`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/functions.html#glob)
  function has a new argument `allow_empty`. When set to `False` (this will be
  the default in the future), the glob fails when it doesn't match anything.
  Please explicitly set `allow_empty = True` to the globs that need it.

### Windows

- Windows, Python: the new `--incompatible_windows_escape_python_args` flag
  (`false` by default) builds `py_binary` and `py_test` targets with correct
  command line argument escaping. Similar to
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7486 but for `py_*` rules.

### Other changes

- cquery supports `--output=build`

- Generated Go protobufs now depend on `//net/proto2/go:proto_gendeps` instead
  of `//net/proto2/go:proto`

- Added `--incompatible_remove_binary_profile` to disable the old binary
  profiles. Instead use the JSON profile format:
  https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/performance.html#json-profile

- Introducing `--execution_log_binary_file` and `--execution_log_json_file`
  that output a stable sorted execution log. They will offer a stable
  replacement to `--experimental_execution_log_file`.

- New platform_mappings ability to allow gradual flag to platforms/toolchains
  migration. See also https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6426

- Added support for compiling against fully qualified `R` classes from
  `aar_import` dependencies.

- `--tls_enabled` flag is deprecated. Please provide `grpcs` as a scheme in
  the URLs if TLS should be used for a remote connection.

### Community

- Alex Eagle gave a talk at ng-conf:
  [The Bazel Opt-in Preview is Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1lnp-nU4wM)

- The latest release of
  [rules_haskell](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/releases/tag/v0.9)
  includes many new improvements, including an initial Windows support.

- The latest
  [Buildifier release](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/releases/tag/0.25.1)
  includes Windows binaries, as well as a JSON output for diagnostics.

Incompatible changes:

  - (Starlark rules) The legacy "py" provider can no longer be passed
    to or produced by native Python rules; use
    [PyInfo](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/PyIn
    fo.html) instead. See
    [#7298](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7298) for more
    information.
  - (Python rules) The `default_python_version` attribute of the
    `py_binary` and `py_test` rules has been renamed to
    `python_version`. Also, the `--force_python` flag has been
    renamed to `--python_version`. See
    [#7308](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7308) for more
    information.
  - (Python rules) The python version now changes to whatever version
    is specified in a `py_binary` or `py_test`'s `python_version`
    attribute, instead of being forced to the value set by a command
    line flag. You can temporarily revert this change with
    `--incompatible_allow_python_version_transitions=false`. See
    [#7307](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7307) for more
    information.
  - --incompatible_disable_third_party_license_checking` is enabled
    by default
  - Introduced --incompatible_use_python_toolchains, which supersedes
    --python_top/--python_path. See #7899 and #7375 for more
    information.
  - Python 3 is now the default Python version (for `py_binary` and
    `py_test` targets that don't specify the `python_version`
    attribute). Targets that are built for Python 3 will no longer
    have their output put in a separate `-py3` directory; instead
    there is now a separate `-py2` directory for Python 2 targets.
    See #7359 and #7593 for more information.
  - objc_library resource attributes are now disabled by default.
    Please migrate them to data instead. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7594 for more info.
  - Flip --incompatible_windows_escape_jvm_flags to true. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7486

New features:

  - genrules now support a $(RULEDIR) variable that resolves to the
    directory where the outputs of the rule are put.
  - Added --incompatible_windows_native_test_wrapper flag: enables
    using the Bash-less test wrapper on Windows. (No-op on other
    platforms.)

Important changes:

  - incompatible_use_jdk11_as_host_javabase: makes JDK 11 the default
    --host_javabase for remote jdk
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7219)
  - Makes genquery somepath output deterministic.
  - Tristate attributes of native rules now reject True/False (use
    1/0)
  - Rollback of "Tristate attributes of native rules now reject
    True/False (use 1/0)"
  - Tristate attributes of native rules now reject True/False (use
    1/0)
  - Added -incompatible_do_not_split_linking_cmdline flag. See #7670
  - Tristate attributes of native rules now temporarily accept
    True/False again

  - --incompatible_no_transitive_loads is enabled by default.
  - Makes TreeArtifact deterministic.
  - --incompatible_no_transitive_loads is enabled by default.

    only string elements.
  - --incompatible_symlinked_sandbox_expands_tree_artifacts_in_runfile
    s_tree has been flipped
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_disable_legacy_cc_provider` has
    been flipped (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7036
    for details).
  - Don't drop the analysis cache when the same --define flag is set
    multiple times and the last value is the same (e.g. if the
    current invocation was run with "--define foo=bar" and the
    previous one was run with "--define foo=baz --define foo=bar").
  - The --incompatible_disable_genrule_cc_toolchain_dependency flag
    has been flipped (see

    APIs instead of configured targets
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7186.)
  - --incompatible_remote_symlinks has been flipped. The remote
    caching and execution protocol will now represent symlinks in
    outputs as such. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7917 for more details.
  - Bazel is now ~20MiB smaller, from unbundling the Android rules'
    runtime dependencies.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Added --incompatible_py3_is_default to test switching the default
    Python version to PY3 for py_binary/py_test targets that do not
    specify a version. See #7359.
  - //tools/cmd_line_differ has been renamed to //tools/aquery_differ
    & can now compare (in addition to command lines) inputs of
    actions given 2 aquery results.
  - java_(mutable_|)proto_library: removed strict_deps attribute.
  - The flag --incompatible_list_based_execution_strategy_selection
    was added and is used to ease the migration to the new style of
    specifying
    execution strategy selection and fallback behavior. The
    documentation for
    this flag is here: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7480
  - Added --incompatible_py2_outputs_are_suffixed, for switching the
    bazel-bin symlink to point to Python 3 outputs instead of Python
    2 outputs. See
    [#7593](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7593).

New features:

  - Make actions.args() object chainable.
  - Added --incompatible_windows_style_arg_escaping flag: enables
    correct subprocess argument escaping on Windows. (No-op on other
    platforms.)
  - Added --incompatible_windows_escape_jvm_flags flag: enables
    correct java_binary.jvm_flags and java_test.jvm_flags
    tokenization and escaping on Windows. (No-op on other platforms.)

Important changes:

  - Allow running aquery against the current state of Skyframe
  - Added support for the "navigation" resource directory to Android
    resource processing in Bazel. This is used by the Navigation
    Architecture Component.
  - --incompatible_disable_runtimes_filegroups was flipped
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6942)
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_linkopts_in_user_link_flags`
    has been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6826)
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_dont_emit_static_libgcc` has
    been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6825)
  - --incompatible_disallow_filetype is enabled by default.
  - Fixed issue where exceptions and stacktraces were silently
    swallowed in the Android resource processing pipeline.
  - `--incompatible_disable_expand_if_all_available_in_flag_set` has
    been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7008)
  - --incompatible_disallow_dict_plus is enabled by default
  - Adds --incompatible_disable_objc_library_resources to disable
    resource attributes in objc_library. Please migrate these
    attributes to `data` instead.
  - --incompatible_disallow_old_style_args_add is enabled by default.
  - Using the `native` module in BUILD files is deprecated. It will
    be forbidden with --incompatible_disallow_native_in_build_file.
  - (Python rules) PyRuntimeInfo is exposed to Starlark, making it
    possible for Starlark rules to depend on or imitate `py_runtime`.
    The `files` attribute of `py_runtime` is no longer mandatory.
  - incompatible_use_toolchain_providers_in_java_common: pass
    JavaToolchainInfo and JavaRuntimeInfo providers to java_common
    APIs instead of configured
    targetshttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7186.
  - is_using_fission crosstool variable is now exposed in all compile
    actions when fission is active (it used to be exposed only for
    linking actions).
  - incompatible_use_toolchain_providers_in_java_common: pass
    JavaToolchainInfo and JavaRuntimeInfo providers to java_common
    APIs instead of configured
    targetshttps://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7186.
  - `py_runtime` gains a `python_version` attribute for specifying
    whether it represents a Python 2 or 3 interpreter.
  - `--incompatible_java_coverage` is enabled by default.
  - Starlark rules can safely declare attributes named "licenses"
  - When using
    --incompatible_list_based_execution_strategy_selection, Bazel
    will use remote execution by default (if you specify
    --remote_executor), otherwise persistent workers (if the action
    supports it), otherwise sandboxed local execution (if the action
    and platform supports it) and at last unsandboxed local
    execution. The flags --spawn_strategy and --strategy continue to
    work as before - this only sets new defaults for the case where
    you don't specify these flags.
  - Set default value of --incompatible_remap_main_repo to true.
  - Set default value of --incompatible_remap_main_repo to true.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - //src:bazel uses the minimal embedded JDK, if you want to
    avoid the extra steps of minimizing the JDK, use //src:bazel-dev
    instead.
  - //src:bazel uses the minimal embedded JDK, if you want to
    avoid the extra steps of building bazel with the minimized JDK,
    use //src:bazel-dev
    instead.
  - The default value of --host_platform and --platforms will be
      changed to not be dependent on the configuration. This means
    that setting
      --cpu or --host_cpu will not affect the target or host platform.
  - Toolchain resolution for cc rules is now enabled via an
    incompatible flag, --incompatible_enable_cc_toolchain_resolution.
    The previous
    flag, --enabled_toolchain_types, is deprecated and will be
    removed.
  - java_(mutable_|)proto_library: removed strict_deps attribute.
  - Python rules will soon reject the legacy "py" struct provider
    (preview by enabling --incompatible_disallow_legacy_py_provider).
    Upgrade rules to use PyInfo instead. See
    [#7298](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7298).
  - java_(mutable_|)proto_library: removed strict_deps attribute.
  - Two changes to native Python rules: 1) `default_python_version`
    and `--force_python` are deprecated; use `python_version` and
    `--python_version` respectively instead. You can preview the
    removal of the deprecated names with
    --incompatible_remove_old_python_version_api. See
    [#7308](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7308). 2) The
    version flag will no longer override the declared version of a
    `py_binary` or `py_test` target. You can preview this new
    behavior with --incompatible_allow_python_version_transitions.
    See [#7307](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7307).

Important changes:

  - There is a new flag available
    `--experimental_java_common_create_provider_enabled_packages`
    that acts as a whitelist for usages of
    `java_common.create_provider`. The constructor will be deprecated
    in Bazel 0.23.
  - [#7024] Allow chaining of the same function type in aquery.
  - Introduces --local_{ram,cpu}_resources, which will take the place
    of --local_resources.
  - [#6930] Add documentation for the aquery command.
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_dont_emit_static_libgcc` has
    been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6825)
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_linkopts_in_user_link_flags`
    has been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6826)
  - Flag --incompatible_range_type is removed.
  - Flag --incompatible_disallow_slash_operator is removed.
  - Flag --incompatible_disallow_conflicting_providers is removed.
  - `--incompatible_disallow_data_transition` is now enabled by
    default
  - Allow inclusion of param files in aquery output
  - [#6985] Add test to verify aquery's behavior for Cpp action
    templates.
  - --incompatible_require_feature_configuration_for_pic was flipped
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7007).
  - Also ignore module-info.class in multi-version Jars
  - objc_framework has been deleted. Please refer to
    apple_dynamic_framework_import and apple_static_framework_import
    rules available in
    [rules_apple](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/maste
    r/doc/rules-general.md)
  - --test_sharding_strategy=experimental_heuristic is no more
  - objc_bundle_library has been removed. Please migrate to
    rules_apple's
    [apple_resource_bundle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/
    blob/master/doc/rules-resources.md#apple_resource_bundle).
  - You can now use the attribute `aapt_version` or the flag
    `--android_aapt` to pick the aapt version for android_local_test
    tests
  - In --keep_going mode, Bazel now correctly returns a non-zero exit
    code when encountering a package loading error during target
    pattern parsing of patterns like "//foo:all" and "//foo/...".
  - The default value for --incompatible_strict_action_env has been
    flipped to 'false' again, as we discovered breakages for local
    execution users. We'll need some more time to figure out the best
    way to make this work for local and remote execution. Follow
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7026 for more details.
  - Locally-executed spawns tagged "no-cache" no longer upload their
    outputs to the remote cache.
  - Introduces --host_compiler flag to allow setting a compiler for
    host compilation when --host_crosstool_top is specified.
  - --incompatible_expand_directories is enabled by default
  - [aquery] Handle the case of aspect-on-aspect.
  - Fixed a longstanding bug in the http remote cache where the value
    passed to
    --remote_timeout would be interpreted as milliseconds instead of
    seconds.
  - Enable --incompatible_use_jdk10_as_host_javabase by default, see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6661
  - Add --incompatible_use_jdk11_as_host_javabase: makes JDK 11 the
    default --host_javabase for remote jdk
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7219)
  - Highlight TreeArtifact in aquery text output.
  - Locally-executed spawns tagged "no-cache" no longer upload their
    outputs to the remote cache.
  - java_common APIs now accept JavaToolchainInfo and JavaRuntimeInfo
    instead of configured targets for java_toolchain and java_runtime
  - cc_common.create_cc_toolchain_config_info is stable and available
    for production use
  - incompatible_use_toolchain_providers_in_java_common: pass
    JavaToolchainInfo and JavaRuntimeInfo providers to java_common
    APIs instead of configured targets
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7186)
  - --incompatible_strict_argument_ordering is enabled by default.
  - Bazel now supports reading cache hits from a repository cache,
    even if it doesn't have write access to the cache.
  - Adding arm64e to OSX CROSSTOOL.
  - Ignore package-level licenses on config_setting.
  - Add an optional output_source_jar parameter to java_common.compile
  - --incompatible_disable_objc_provider_resources is now enabled by
    default. This disables ObjcProvider's fields related to resource
    processing.
  - Explicitly set https.protocols and exclude TLSv1.3.
  - Bazel now validates that JAVA_HOME points to a valid JDK and
    falls back to auto-detection by looking up the path of `javac`.
  - Upgrade the embedded JDK version to 11.0.2.
  - Added --incompatible_disable_crosstool_file
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7320)
  - --incompatible_disable_objc_provider_resources is now enabled by
    default. This disables ObjcProvider's fields related to resource
    processing.
  - --incompatible_disable_tools_defaults_package has been flipped.
  - For tests that do not generate a test.xml, Bazel now uses a
    separate action to generate one; this results in minor

    more reliable overall.
  - incompatible_generate_javacommon_source_jar: java_common.compile

    --incompatible_disallow_struct_provider_syntax removes the
    ability for rule implementation functions to return struct. Such
    functions should return a list of providers instead. Migration

The Bazel team is happy to announce a new release of Bazel,
[Bazel 0.22.0](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.22.0).

Baseline: deb028e3fb30b4e2953df16f35ab1f55a08ea8fa

### Breaking changes

- [`--incompatible_string_is_not_iterable`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5830)

### Upcoming changes

This release is a [migration window for the following changes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/migration-0.22).

- [`--incompatible_disallow_data_transition`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6153)
- [`--incompatible_dont_emit_static_libgcc`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6825)
- [`--incompatible_linkopts_in_user_link_flags`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6826)
- [`--incompatible_disable_legacy_crosstool_fields`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6861)
- [`--incompatible_use_aapt2_by_default`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6907)
- [`--incompatible_disable_runtimes_filegroups`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6942)
- [`--incompatible_disable_legacy_cc_provider`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7036)
- [`--incompatible_require_feature_configuration_for_pic`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7007)
- [`--incompatible_disable_expand_if_all_available_in_flag_set`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7008)
- [`--incompatible_disable_legacy_proto_provider`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7152)
- [`--incompatible_disable_proto_source_root`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7153)

### General Changes

- https://docs.bazel.build now supports versioned
  documentation. Use the selector at the top of the navigation bar
  to switch between documentation for different Bazel releases.

- set `projectId` in all `PublishBuildToolEventStreamRequest`

### Android

- mobile-install now works with aapt2. Try it out with `bazel
  mobile-install --android_aapt=aapt2 //my:target`

- Fixed issues with mobile-install v1 when deploying to Android 9 Pie
  devices. https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6814

- Fixed issue where error messages from Android manifest merging
  actions were not fully propagated.

- New incompatible change flag `--incompatible_use_aapt2_by_default`
  for defaulting to aapt2 in Android builds has been added. To build with
  aapt2 today, pass the flag
  `--incompatible_use_aapt2_by_default=true` or
  `--android_aapt=aapt2`, or set the `aapt_version`  to `aapt2` on
  your `android_binary` or `android_local_test` target.

- Fixed mobile-install v1 error when installing an app with native
  libraries onto an Android 9 (Pie) device. See
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/issues/77

- Fixed a mobile-install bug where `arm64-v8a` libraries were not
  deployed correctly on `arm64` devices. This was done by enabling
  incremental native lib deployment by default. A previously
  undocumented `--android_incremental_native_libs` flag is removed,
  and is now the regular behavior. See
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2239

### Apple

- The `objc_bundle` rule has been removed. Please migrate to rules_apple's
  [apple_bundle_import](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/bl
  ob/master/doc/rules-resources.md#apple_bundle_import).

- The `apple_stub_binary` rule has been deleted.

- The `--xbinary_fdo` option that passes xbinary profiles has been added.

### C++

- `cc_toolchain.(static|dynamic)_runtime_libs` attributes are now optional

### Packaging

- `build_tar.py` in `tools/build_defs/pkg` now supports a JSON manifest
  that can be used to add paths that have symbols that can't be
  specified via the command line

### Query

- Filtering of inputs, outputs, and mnemonic filtering have been added to
  aquery.

- The aquery and cquery query2 tests have been open-sourced.

- The Bazel query how-to recommends ":*" instead of ":all", because "all" might
  be the name of a target.

### Testing

- The `--runs_per_test` has been placed in the TESTING documentation category.

- A a clarifying message has been added to test case summary output when all
  test cases pass but the target fails.

### Contributors

This release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as
Benjamin Peterson, Dave Lee, George Gensure, Gert van Dijk, Gustavo Storti
Salibi, Keith Smiley, Loo Rong Jie, Lukasz Tekieli, Mikhail Mazurskiy, Thi,
Travis Cline, Vladimir Chebotarev, and Yannic.

## Release 0.21.0 (2018-12-19)

```
Baseline: cb9b2afbba3f8d3a1db8bf68e65d06f1b36902f5

Cherry picks:

   + 12b96466ee0d6ab83f7d4cd24be110bb5021281d:
     Windows, test wrapper: rename the associated flag
   + 7fc967c4d6435de2bb4e34aac00ca2e499f55fca:

   + dbe05df23ccf4c919379e0294e0701fd3f66739c:
     Update the version of  skylib bundled in the distfile
```

Incompatible changes:

  - The --experimental_stl command line option is removed.
  - aquery defaults to human readable output format.

New features:

  - repository_ctx.download and repository_ctx.download_and_extract
    now return a struct.
  - Android Databinding v2 can be enabled with
    --experimental_android_databinding_v2.

Important changes:

  - The deprecated and unmaintained Docker rules in
    tools/build_defs/docker were removed. Please use
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker instead.
  - The new --upload_query_output_using_bep query/cquery/aquery flag
    causes query outputs to be uploaded via BEP.
  - New incompatible flag --incompatible_strict_argument_ordering
  - --strict_android_deps and --strict_java_deps were renamed to
    --experimental_strict_java_deps
  - config_settings that select on "compiler" value instead of values
    = {"compiler" : "x"} should use flag_values =
    {"@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:compiler": "x"}.
  - The new --upload_query_output_using_bep query/cquery/aquery flag
    causes query outputs to be uploaded via BEP.
  - Turn on --incompatible_disable_sysroot_from_configuration
  - We revamped our Android with Bazel tutorial! Check it out
    [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/tutorial/android-a
    pp.html).
  - --incompatible_disallow_slash_operator is now on by default
  - Enable --experimental_check_desugar_deps by default.  This flag
    rules out several types of invalid Android builds at compile-time.
  - The --max_config_changes_to_show option lists the names of
    options which
    have changed and thus caused the analysis cache to be dropped.
  - The --experimental_strict_action_env option has been renamed to
    --incompatible_strict_action_env and is now on by default. This
    means Bazel will no longer use the client's PATH and
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variables in the default action
    environment. If the old behavior is desired, pass
    --action_env=PATH and --action_env=LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    --noincompatible_strict_action_env will also temporarily restore
    the old behavior. However, as --action_env is a more general and
    explicit way to pass client environmental variables into actions,
    --noincompatible_strict_action_env will eventually be deprecated
    and removed. See #6648 for more details.
  - XCRUNWRAPPER_LABEL has been removed. If you used this value
    before, please use @bazel_tools//tools/objc:xcrunwrapper instead.
  - --incompatible_static_name_resolution is no unable by default
  - We will phase out --genrule_strategy in favor of
    --strategy=Genrule=<value> (for genrules) or
    --spawn_strategy=<value> (for all actions).
  - --incompatible_package_name_is_a_function is now enabled by
    default
  - Dynamic execution is now available with
    --experimental_spawn_strategy. Dynamic execution allows a build
    action to run locally and remotely simultaneously, and Bazel
    picks the fastest action. This provides the best of both worlds:
    faster clean builds than pure local builds, and faster
    incremental builds than pure remote builds.
  - --incompatible_package_name_is_a_function is now enabled by
    default
  - New incompatible flag --incompatible_merge_genfiles_directory
  - grpc log now logs updateActionResult
  - CppConfiguration doesn't do package loading anymore. That means:
    * it's no longer needed to have C++ toolchain available when
    building non-C++ projects
    * bazel will not analyze C++ toolchain when not needed -> speedup
    ~2s on bazel startup when C++ rules using hermetic toolchain are
    not loaded
  - --incompatible_package_name_is_a_fu...

Incompatible changes:

  - the --experimental_no_dotd_scanning_with_modules command line
    argument is not supported anymore.
  - The --prune_cpp_modules command line option is not supported
    anymore.
  - the --experimental_prune_cpp_input_discovery command line option
    is not supported anymore.

New features:

  - Added support for Android NDK r18.

Important changes:

  - The 'default' parameter of attr.output and attr.output_list is
    removed. This is controlled by
    --incompatible_no_output_attr_default
  - A number of platform-related Starlark APIs which were previously
    marked "experimental" are now disabled by default, and may be
    enabled via --experimental_platforms_api
  - Make legacy-test-support ("legacy_test-<api-level>") from
    android_sdk_repository neverlink. The legacy test support
    libraries shouldn't be built into test binaries. To make them
    available at runtime, developers should declare them via
    uses-library:
    https://developer.android.com/training/testing/set-up-project#andr
    oid-test-base
  - query remote server Capabilities (per REAPI v2)
  - CppRules: All cc_toolchains depended on from
    cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains are now analyzed when not using
    platforms in order to select the right cc_toolchain.
  - removed obsolete --explicit_jre_deps flag.
  - Incompatible flag
    --incompatible_disable_legacy_cpp_toolchain_skylark_api was
    flipped.
  - Improve error messaging when unsupport proguard options are
    specified at the library level.
  - Incompatible flag
    --incompatible_disable_legacy_cpp_toolchain_skylark_api was
    flipped.
  - Incompatible flag
    --incompatible_disable_legacy_cpp_toolchain_skylark_api was
    flipped.
  - The --incompatible_disable_late_bound_option_defaults flag has
    been flipped (#6384)
  - Incompatible flag
    --incompatible_disable_legacy_flags_cc_toolchain_api was flipped
    (#6434)
  - Fixed issue where ctx.resolve_command created conflicting
    intermediate files when resolve_command was called multiple times
    within the same rule invocation with a long command attribute.
  - Incompatible flag
    --incompatible_disable_cc_configuration_make_variables was
    flipped (#6381)
  - If the --javabase flag is unset, it Bazel locates a JDK using
    the JAVA_HOME environment variable and searching the PATH. If no
    JDK is found --javabase will be empty, and builds targeting Java
    will not
    be supported. Previously Bazel would fall back to using the
    embedded
    JDK as a --javabase, but this is no longer default behaviour. A
    JDK should
    be explicitly installed instead to enable Java development
  - Bazel will now shut down when idle for 5 minutes and the system
    is low on RAM (linux only).
  - CROSSTOOL file is now read from the package of cc_toolchain, not
    from
    the package of cc_toolchain_suite. This is not expected to break
    anybody since
    cc_toolchain_suite and cc_toolchain are commonly in the same
    package.
  - All overrides of Starlark's ctx.new_file function are now
    deprecated.
      Try the `--incompatible_new_actions_api` flag to ensure your
    code is forward-compatible.
  - --incompatible_disable_cc_toolchain_label_from_crosstool_proto
    was flipped.
  - Introduce --(no)shutdown_on_low_sys_mem startup flag to toggle
    idle low-memory shutdown, disabled by default.
  - --incompatible_disable_cc_toolchain_label_from_crosstool_proto
    was flipped.
  - --incompatible_disable_cc_toolchain_label_from_crosstool_proto
    was flipped.
  - CppRules: All cc_toolchains depended on from
    cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains are now analyzed when not using
    platforms in order to select the right cc_toolchain.
  - The function `attr.license` is deprecated and will be removed.
      It can be disabled now with `--incompatible_no_attr_license`.
  - `range()` function now returns a lazy value
    (`--incompatible_range_type` is now set by default).
  - The code coverage report now includes the actual paths to header
    files instead of the ugly,
    Bazel generated, virtual includes path.
  - `--incompatible_disallow_conflicting_providers` has been switched
    to true
  - Add new flag `--incompatible_disable_systool_from_configration` to
    disable loading the systool from CppConfiguration.
  - Add new flag `--incompatible_disable_sysroot_from_configuration`
    to
    disable loading the systool from CppConfiguration.
  - Sorting remote Platform properties for remote execution. May
    affect cache keys!
  - Use different server log files per Bazel server process; java.log
    is
    now a symlink to the latest log.

The Bazel team is happy to announce a new version of Bazel, [Bazel 0.19](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.19.0).

This document lists the major changes since Bazel 0.18.

General changes
---------------

* The `--incompatible_expand_directories` flag will automatically expand directories in command lines. Design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11agWFiOUiz2htBLj6swPTob5z78TrCxm8DQE4uJLOwM

* The `--loading_phase_threads` flag now defaults to `auto` (not 200, as was previously the case), which at the moment corresponds to the number of CPUs. This is appropriate for most users. However, if your sources reside on a network file system, increasing this value may yield better analysis-time performance when disk caches are cold.

Android
-------

* Fixed missing debug symbols when building native code with `--compilation_mode=dbg` that target Android ARM architectures by adding the `-g` flag.

C++
---

* Added `--incompatible_disable_legacy_flags_cc_toolchain_api` to deprecate legacy `cc_toolchain` Starlark API for legacy CROSSTOOL fields. Tracking issue is #6434. Migration docs are on the bazel website.

* Runfiles in cc_test: the C++ runfiles library (`@bazel_tools//tools/cpp/runfiles`) can now create Runfiles objects for tests. See `//tools/cpp/runfiles/runfiles_src.h` (in the Bazel source tree) for documentation.

* :cc_binary link action no longer hardcodes `-static-libgcc` for toolchains that support embedded runtimes (guarded by `--experimental_dont_emit_static_libgcc` temporarily).

* The flag `--experimental_enable_cc_configuration_make_variables` is removed, use `--incompatible_disable_cc_configuration_make_variables` instead.

Java
----

* If the `--javabase` flag is unset, Bazel locates a JDK using the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and searching the PATH. If no JDK is found `--javabase` will be empty, and builds targeting Java will not be supported.  Previously Bazel would fall back to using the embedded JDK as a `--javabase`, but this is no longer default behaviour. A JDK should be explicitly installed instead to enable Java development.

Code Coverage
-------------

* LcovMerger was renamed to CoverageOutputGenerator.

* Faster coverage collection for gcc compiled C++ code can now be tested by enabling it with `--experimental_cc_coverage`.

Other Changes
-------------

* Add `--apple_compiler` and `--apple_grte_top options`. These provide the equivalent of --compiler / --grte_top for the toolchain configured in --apple_crosstool_top.

* There is now a `same_pkg_direct_rdeps` query function. See the query documentation for more details.

* Propagating remote errors to the user even if `--verbose_failures=false` is set.

* Add number of configured targets to analysis phase status output.

* Bazel will now check stderr instead of stdout to decide if it is outputting to a terminal.  `--isatty` is deprecated, use `--is_stderr_atty` instead.

Future Changes
--------------

* None of the C++ related incompatible flags mentioned in the 0.18 release were flipped, they will be flipped in the next release (0.20). We have created tracking issues for all the relevant incompatible flags:
    * [`--incompatible_disable_late_bound_option_defaults`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disable-late-bound-option-defaults): #6384
    * [`--incompatible_disable_depset_in_cc_user_flags`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disable-depsets-in-c-toolchain-api-in-user-flags): #6383
    * [`--incompatible_disable_cc_toolchain_label_from_crosstool_proto`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disallow-using-crosstool-to-select-the-cc_toolchain-label): #6382
    * [`--incompatible_disable_cc_configuration_make_variables`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6381): #6381
    * [`--incompatible_disable_legacy_cpp_toolchain_skylark_api`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disable-legacy-c-configuration-api): #6380
    * [`incompatible_disable_legacy_flags_cc_toolchain_api`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disable-legacy-c-toolchain-api): #6434

* In the 0.20 release the flags [`--incompatible_remove_native_git_repository`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#remove-native-git-repository) and [`--incompatible_remove_native_http_archive`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#remove-native-http-archive) will be turned on.

```

General changes

- New [bazelrc file list](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#where-are-the-bazelrc-files).
  If you need to keep both the old and new lists of .rc files active
  concurrently to support multiple versions of Bazel, you can import the old
  file location into the new list using `try-import`. This imports a file if it
  exists and silently exits if it does not. You can use this method to account
  for a user file that may or may not exist

- [.bazelignore](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#.bazelignore)
  is now fully functional.

- The startup flag `--host_javabase` has been renamed to
  `--server_javabase` to avoid confusion with the build flag
  `--host_javabase`.

Android

- The Android resource processing pipeline now supports persistence
  via worker processes. Enable it with
  `--persistent_android_resource_processor`. We have observed a 50% increase
  in build speed for clean local builds and up to 150% increase in build
  speed for incremental local builds.

C++

- In-memory package //tools/defaults has been removed (controlled by
  `--incompatible_disable_tools_defaults_package` flag). Please see
  [migration instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disable-inmemory-tools-defaults-package)
  and migrate soon, the flag will be flipped in Bazel 0.19, and the legacy
  behavior will be removed in Bazel 0.20.

- Late bound option defaults (typical example was the `--compiler` flag, when
  it was not specified, it’s value was computed using the CROSSTOOL) are removed
  (controlled by `--incompatible_disable_late_bound_option_defaults` flag).
  Please see [migration instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disable-late-bound-option-defaults)
  and migrate soon, the flag will be flipped in Bazel 0.19, and the legacy
  behavior will be removed in Bazel 0.20.

- Depsets are no longer accepted in `user_compile_flags` and `user_link_flags`
  in the C++ toolchain API (controlled by
  `--incompatible_disable_depset_in_cc_user_flags` flag) affects C++ users.
  Please see [migration instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disable-depsets-in-c-toolchain-api-in-user-flags)
  and migrate soon, the flag will be flipped in Bazel 0.19, and the legacy
  behavior will be removed in Bazel 0.20.

- CROSSTOOL is no longer consulted when selecting C++ toolchain (controlled by
  `--incompatible_disable_cc_toolchain_label_from_crosstool_proto` flag).
  Please see [migration instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disallow-using-crosstool-to-select-the-cc_toolchain-label)
  and migrate soon, the flag will be flipped in Bazel 0.19, and the legacy behavior will be removed in Bazel 0.20.

- You can now use [`toolchain_identifier` attribute](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/857d4664ce939f240b1d10d8d2baca6c6893cfcb)
  on `cc_toolchain` to pair it with CROSSTOOL toolchain.

- C++ specific Make variables
  are no longer passed from the `CppConfiguration`, but from the C++ toolchain
  (controlled by `--incompatible_disable_cc_configuration_make_variables` flag).
  Please see [migration instructions](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/backward-compatibility.html#disallow-using-c-specific-make-variables-from-the-configuration)
  and migrate soon, the flag will be flipped
  in Bazel 0.19, and the legacy behavior will be removed in Bazel 0.20.

- Skylark api accessing C++
  toolchain in `ctx.fragments.cpp` is removed (controlled by
  `--incompatible_disable_legacy_cpp_toolchain_skylark_api` flag).
  Please migrate soon, the flag will be flipped
  in Bazel 0.19, and the legacy behavior will be removed in Bazel 0.20.

- cc_binary link action no longer hardcodes
  `-static-libgcc` for toolchains that support embedded runtimes
  (guarded by [`--experimental_dont_emit_static_libgcc`](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/2f281960b829e964526a9d292d4c3003e4d19f1c)
  temporarily). Proper deprecation using `--incompatible` flags will follow.

Java

- Future versions of Bazel will require a locally installed JDK
  for Java development. Previously Bazel would fall back to using
  the embedded `--server_javabase` if no JDK as available. Pass
  `--incompatible_never_use_embedded_jdk_for_javabase` to disable the
  legacy behaviour.

- `--javacopt=` no longer affects compilations of tools that are
  executed during the build; use `--host_javacopt=` to change javac
  flags in the host configuration.

Objective C

- `objc_library` now supports the module_name attribute.

Skylark

- Adds `--incompatible_expand_directories` to automatically expand
  directories in skylark command lines. Design doc:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/11agWFiOUiz2htBLj6swPTob5z78TrCxm8DQE4uJLOwM

- Support fileset expansion in ctx.actions.args(). Controlled by
  `--incompatible_expand_directories`.

Windows

- `--windows_exe_launcher` is deprecated, this flag will be removed
  soon. Please make sure you are not using it.

- Bazel now supports the symlink runfiles tree on Windows with
  `--experimental_enable_runfiles` flag. For more details, see
  [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hnYmU1BmtCSJOUvvDAK745DSJQCapToJxb3THXYMrmQ).

Other Changes

- A new experimental option `--experimental_ui_deduplicate` has been added. It
  causes the UI to attempt to deduplicate messages from actions to keep the
  console output cleaner.

- Add `--modify_execution_info`, a flag to customize action execution
  info.

- Add ExecutionInfo to aquery output for ExecutionInfoSpecifier
  actions.

- When computing `--instrumentation_filter`, end filter patterns with
  "[/:]" to match non-top-level packages exactly and treat
  top-level targets consistently.

- Added the `bazel info server_log` command, which obtains the main Bazel
  server log file path. This can help debug Bazel issues.

- `aapt shrink` resources now properly respect filter configurations.

```

Important changes:

  - In the future, Bazel will expand tree artifacts in runfiles, too,
    which causes the sandbox to link each file individually into the
    sandbox directory, instead of symlinking the entire directory. In
    this release, the behavior is not enabled by default yet. Please
    try it out via
    --incompatible_symlinked_sandbox_expands_tree_artifacts_in_runfile
    s_tree and let us know if it causes issues. If everything looks
    good, this behavior will become the default in a following
    release.

Incompatible changes:

  - Loading @bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git_repositories.bzl
    no longer works. Load @bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl
    instead.
  - If the same artifact is generated by two distinct but identical
    actions, and a downstream action has both those actions' outputs
    in its inputs, the artifact will now appear twice in the
    downstream action's inputs. If this causes problems in Skylark
    actions, you can use the uniquify=True argument in Args.add_args.
  - If the same artifact is generated by two distinct but identical
    actions, and a downstream action has both those actions' outputs
    in its inputs, the artifact will now appear twice in the
    downstream action's inputs. If this causes problems in Skylark
    actions, you can use the uniquify=True argument in Args.add_args.
  - Labels in C++ rules' linkopts attribute are not expanded anymore
    unless they are wrapped, e.g: $(location //foo:bar)
  - If the same artifact is generated by two distinct but identical
    actions, and a downstream action has both those actions' outputs
    in its inputs, the artifact will now appear twice in the
    downstream action's inputs. If this causes problems in Skylark
    actions, you can use the uniquify=True argument in Args.add_args.
  - New bazelrc file list.
  - Windows: when BAZEL_SH envvar is not defined and Bazel searches
    for a suitable bash.exe, Bazel will no longer look for Git Bash
    and no longer recommend installing it as a Bash implementation.
    See issue #5751.
  - New bazelrc file list.

New features:

  - The aquery command now supports --output=text.
  - Java, runfiles: the Java runfiles library is now in
    @bazel_tools//tools/java/runfiles. The old target
    (@bazel_tools//tools/runfiles:java-runfiles) is deprecated and
    will be removed in Bazel 0.18.0.
  - Java, runfiles: the Java runfiles library is now in
    @bazel_tools//tools/java/runfiles. The old target
    (@bazel_tools//tools/runfiles:java-runfiles) is deprecated and
    will be removed in Bazel 0.19.0 (not 0.18.0, as stated earlier).

Important changes:

  - Allow @ in package names.
  - Remove support for java_runtime_suite; use alias() together with
    select() instead.
  - Python wrapper scripts for MSVC are removed.
  - [JavaInfo] Outputs are merged in java_common.merge().
  - Faster analysis by improved parallelization.
  - --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path is removed.
  - Introduce the --remote_cache_proxy flag,
    which allows for remote http caching to connect
    via a unix domain socket.
  - No longer define G3_VERSION_INFO for c++ linkstamp compiles, as
    it was a duplicate of G3_TARGET_NAME.
  - Added support for Android NDK r17. The default STL is now
    `libc++`, and support for targeting `mips`, `mips64` and `ARMv5`
    (`armeabi`) has been removed.
  - Add aquery command to get analysis time information about the
    action graph.
  - Fixed compatibility with aar_import when using aapt2.  AAPT2 is
    now supported for Android app builds without resource shrinking.
    To use it, pass the `--android_aapt=aapt2` flag or define
    android_binary.aapt_version=aapt2.
  - Code coverage is collected for Java binaries invoked from sh_test.
  - java_common.compile creates the native headers jar accesible via
    JavaInfo.outputs.native_headers.
  - Deleting deprecated no-op flag --show_package_location
  - The JDK shipped with Bazel was updated to JDK10.
  - Rename the startup flag --host_javabase to --server_javabase to
    avoid confusion with the build flag --host_javabase
  - newly added options --experimental_repository_hash_file and
      --experimental_verify_repository_rules allow to verify for
    repositories
      the directory generated against pre-recorded hashes. See
    documentation
      for those options.
  - Removed the gen_jars output group
  - --subcommands can now take a "pretty_print" value
    ("--subcommands=pretty_print") to print the
    arguments of subcommands as a list for easier reading.
  - follow-up to
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/1ac359743176e659e9c7472
    645e3142f3c44b9e8
  - A rule error is now thrown if a Skylark rule implementation
    function returns multiple providers of the same type.
  - When using Bazel's remote execution feature and Bazel has to
    fallback to local execution for an action, Bazel used
    non-sandboxed
    local execution until now. From this release on, you can use the
    new
    flag --remote_local_fallback_strategy=<strategy> to tell Bazel
    which
    strategy to use in that case.
  - Execution Log Parser can now, when printing it out, filter the
    log by runner type
  - A rule error is now thrown if a Skylark rule implementation
    function returns multiple providers of the same type.
  - Removed the gen_jars output group
  - Removed the gen_jars output group
  - Set --defer_param_files to default to true.
  - Sort attribute lists in proto-form query output to fix
    non-deterministic genquery output.
  - Replace 0/1 with False/True for testonly attribute
  - bazel now supports a .bazelignore file specifying
      directories to be ignored; however, these directories still
      have to be well founded and, in particular, may not contain
      symlink cycles.
  - Add more detailed reporting of the differences between startup
    options.
  - update data binding to 3.2.0
  - For Android incremental dexing actions, Bazel now persists its
    DexBuilder process across individual actions. From our
    benchmarks, this results in a 1.2x speedup for clean local builds.
  - The standard `xcode_VERSION` feature now always uses exactly two
    components in the version, even if you specify `--xcode_version`
    with
    more or fewer than two.
  - A rule error will be thrown if a Skylark rule implementation
    function returns multiple providers of the same type. Try the
    `--incompatible_disallow_conflicting_providers` flag to ensure
    your code is forward-compatible.
  - Removed notion of FULLY_STATIC linking mode from C++ rules.
  - In documentation, we've renamed Skylark into Starlark.
  - Execution Log Parser can now, when printing it out, reorder the
    actions for easier text diffs
  - Linkstamps are no longer recompiled after server restart.
  - Use VanillaJavaBuilder and disable header compilation in
    toolchain_hostjdk8. The default toolchain will soon drop
    compatibility with JDK 8. Using a JDK 8 host_javabase
    will only be supported when using 'VanillaJavaBuilder' (which
    does not support Error Prone,
    Strict Java Deps, or reduced classpaths) and with header
    compilation disabled.
  - In the future, Bazel will expand tree artifacts in runfiles, too,
    which causes the sandbox to link each file individually into the
    sandbox directory, instead of symlinking the entire directory. In
    this release, the behavior is not enabled by default yet. Please
    try it out via
    --incompatible_symlinked_sandbox_expands_tree_artifacts_in_runfile
    s_tree and let us know if it causes issues. If everything looks
    good, this behavior will become the default in a following
    release.

This release is a patch release that contains fixes for several serious
regressions that were found after the release of Bazel 0.16.0.

In particular this release resolves the following issues:

 - Bazel crashes with a StackOverflowError on Windows (See #5730)
 - Bazel requires a locally installed JDK and does not fall back
   to the embedded JDK (See #5744)
 - Bazel fails to build for Homebrew on macOS El Capitan (See #5777)
 - A regression in apple_static_library (See #5683)

Please watch our blog for a more detailed release announcement.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - The $(ANDROID_CPU) Make variable is not available anymore. Use
    $(TARGET_CPU) after an Android configuration transition instead.
  - The $(JAVA_TRANSLATIONS) Make variable is not supported anymore.
  - Skylark structs (using struct()) may no longer have to_json and
    to_proto overridden.
  - The mobile-install --skylark_incremental_res flag is no longer
    available, use the --skylark flag instead.

New features:

  - android_local_test now takes advantage of Robolectric's binary
    resource processing which allows for faster tests.
  - Allow @ in package names.

Important changes:

  - Option --glibc is removed, toolchain selection relies solely on
    --cpu and --compiler options.
  - Build support for enabling cross binary FDO optimization.
  - The --distdir option is no longer experimental. This
      option allows to specify additional directories to look for
      files before trying to fetch them from the network. Files from
      any of the distdirs are only used if a checksum for the file
      is specified and both, the filename and the checksum, match.
  - Java coverage works now with multiple jobs.
  - Flip default value of --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path to
    true, Bazel now generates short object file path by default.
  - New rules for importing Android dependencies:
    `aar_import_external` and `aar_maven_import_external`.
    `aar_import_external` enables specifying external AAR
    dependencies using a list of HTTP URLs for the artifact.
    `aar_maven_import_external` enables specifying external AAR
    dependencies using the artifact coordinate and a list of server
    URLs.
  - The BAZEL_JAVAC_OPTS environment variable allows arguments, e.g.,
    "-J-Xmx2g", may be passed to the javac compiler during bootstrap
    build. This is helpful if your system chooses too small of a max
    heap size for the Java compiler during the bootstrap build.
  - --noexpand_configs_in_place is deprecated.
  - A tool to parse the Bazel execution log.
  - Support for LIPO has been fully removed.
  - Remove support for --discard_actions_after_execution.
  - Add --materialize_param_files flag to write parameter files even
    when actions are executed remotely.
  - Windows default system bazelrc is read from the user's
    ProgramData if present.
  - --[no]allow_undefined_configs no longer exists, passing undefined
    configs is an error.
  - In remote caching we limit the number of open
    TCP connections to 100 by default. The number can be adjusted
    by specifying the --remote_max_connections flag.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel now always runs binaries in with "bazel run" in
    interactive mode. The "--nodirect_run" command line option is now
    a no-op.
  - "bazel run --noas_test" is not supported anymore.
  - Indentation on the first line of a file was previously ignored.
    This is now fixed.

New features:

  - C++,runfiles: to access data-dependencies (runfiles) in C++
    programs, use the runfiles library built into Bazel. For usage
    info, see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/cpp/runfiles
    /runfiles.h

Important changes:

  - Bazel now allows almost all 7-bit ASCII characters in labels.
  - Remove vestigial java_plugin.data attribute
  - Bazel supports including select Java 8 APIs into Android apps
    targeting pre-Nougat Android devices with
    --experimental_desugar_java8_libs
  - Flag `--incompatible_disable_glob_tracking` is removed.
  - SkyQuery's rbuildfiles now returns targets corresponding to
    broken packages.
  - Introduce build support for providing cache prefetch hints.
  - Update the skylark DefaultInfo documentation to spell out
    runfiles, data_runfiles and default_runfiles
  - An internal action for symlinking runfiles will use Command
    instead of a Spawns. This should have no functional chages; the
    only user visible consequence should be that the internal action
    is no longer be included in statistics when calculating processes
    count.
  - --batch is deprecated
  - execution strategies line no longer handles differently the case
    where all processes have the same strategy.
  - The --experimental_remote_spawn_cache flag is now enabled by
    default, and remote caching no longer needs --*_strategy=remote
    flags (it will fail if they are specified).
  - android_binary.aapt_version='aapt2' now supports en_XA and ar_XB
  - Added --apple_enable_auto_dsym_dbg flag.
  - non_propagated_deps has been removed from objc_library and
    apple_binary.
  - For Android projects, Bazel now supports building fonts as
    resources. See
    https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/fonts-in-xml
    for more information on the feature.
  - With --incompatible_no_support_tools_in_action_inputs enabled, Skylark
    action inputs are no longer scanned for tools. Move any such
    inputs to the newly introduced 'tools' attribute.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Add --incompatible_disallow_legacy_javainfo flag.
  - Added flag --incompatible_disallow_old_style_args_add to help
    migrate from args.add() to args.add_all() / args.add_joined()
    where appropriate.

New features:

  - Bash,runfiles: use the new platform-independent library in
    `@bazel_tools//tools/bash/runfiles` to access runfiles
    (data-dependencies). See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/bash/runfile
    s/runfiles.bash for usage information.
  - TemplateVariableInfo can now be constructed from Skylark.
  - The java_host_runtime_alias rule is now implemented in Java.

Important changes:

  - Flip default value of --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path to
    true, Bazel now generates short object file path by default.
  - Introduce fdo_profile rule that allows architecture-sensitive
    specification of fdo profiles.
  - canonicalize-flags no longer reorders the flags
  - CppRules: optional_compiler_flag was removed from CROSSTOOL, use
    features instead.
  - Labels of the form ////foo are disallowed.
  - The `/` operator is deprecated in favor of `//` (floor integer
    division).
      Try the `--incompatible_disallow_slash_operator` flag to ensure
    your code
      is forward-compatible.
  - Flip default value of --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path to
    true, Bazel now generates short object file path by default.
  - Exposed "mnemonic" and "env" fields on skylark "Action" objects.
  - Removed flag `--incompatible_disallow_toplevel_if_statement`.
  - Remove vestigial 'deps' and 'data' attributes from
    proto_lang_toolchain
  - Args objects (ctx.actions.args()) have new methods add_all() and
    add_joined() for building command lines using depsets.
  - `FileType` is deprecated and will be removed soon.
      Try the `--incompatible_disallow_filetype` flag to ensure your
    code
      is forward-compatible.
  - Introduce absolute_path_profile attribute that allows fdo_profile
    to accept absolute paths.
  - Support two-arg overloads for ctx.actions.args (eg.
    args.add("--foo", val))
  - Introduce 'tools' attribute to ctx.actions.run.
  - Fixed error message for proguard_apply_dictionary.
  - "bazel run" now lets one run interactive binaries. The
    BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY and BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY environment
    variables indicate the working directory and the workspace root
    of the Bazel invocation. Tests are provided with an approximation
    of the official test environment.
  - repository rules are no longer restricted to return None.
  - Add --high_priority_workers flag.
  - CppRules: Feature configuration can be created from Skylark
  - Adds new-style JavaInfo provider constructor.
  - Make java_common.compile now uses java_toolchain javacopts by
    default; explicitly retrieving them using
    java_common.default_javac_opts is unnecessary.
  - CppRules: C++ command lines and env variables for C++ actions can
    be retrieved from feature configuration.
  - Skylark rule definitions may advertise providers that targets of
    the rule must propagate.
  - Bazel now supports running actions inside Docker containers.
    To use this feature, run "bazel build --spawn_strategy=docker
    --experimental_docker_image=myimage:latest".
  - Remote execution works for Windows binaries with launchers.
  - Fixing start/end lib expansion for linking. There were many cases
    where archive files were still being used with toolchains that
    support start/end lib. This change consolidates the places that
    make that decision so they can be more consistent.
  - Add support for reporting an error if
    android_test.binary_under_test contains incompatible versions of
    deps
  - We replaced the --experimental_local_disk_cache and
    --experimental_local_disk_cache_path flags into a single
    --disk_cache flag. Additionally, Bazel now tries to create the disk cache
    directory if it doesn't exist.
  - Save Blaze memory by not storing LinkerInput objects in
    LinkCommandLine
  - In the JavaInfo created by java_common.create_provider now
    includes both direct and transitive arguments in
    transitive_compile_time_jars and transitive_runtime_jars
  - Allow --worker_max_instances to take MnemonicName=value to
    specify max for each worker.
  - Allow java_toolchain.header_compiler to be an arbitrary executable

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Remove //tools/defaults:android_jar. Use
    @bazel_tools//tools/android:android_jar instead.
  - The flag --incompatible_show_all_print_messages is removed.
    Messages generated by `print` statements from any package will be
    displayed as
    DEBUG messages.
  - The --incompatible_disallow_uncalled_set_constructor flag is no
    longer available, the `set` constructor` is completely removed
    from Skylark.
    Use `depset` instead.
  - Variables PACKAGE_NAME and REPOSITORY_NAME are deprecated in
    favor of
      functions `package_name()` and `repository_name()`.

    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/native.html#p
    ackage_name
  - BUILD_TIMESTAMP now contains seconds (and not milliseconds) since
    the epoch.

New features:

  - Strings have a new .elems() method, that provides an iterator on
    the characters of the string.
  - Now you can access three functions in windows_cc_configure.bzl by:
      load("@bazel_tools/tools/cpp:windows_cc_configure.bzl",
    "<function_name>")

Important changes:

  - CppRules: Unified action_configs for static libraries
  - Remove support for blaze dump --vfs. It is no longer meaningful.
  - Enable dependency checking for aar_import targets.
  - internal_bootstrap_hack has been deprecated and removed.
  - Properly handle tree artifacts on the link command line coming
    from a cc_library dependency.
  - Allow C++ features to make proto_library emit smaller C++ code
  - The 'j2objc' configuration fragment is exposed to Skylark.
  - Remove the default content of the global bazelrc.
  - In int() function, do not auto-detect base if input starts with
    '0'.
  - Users can now pass --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path=true to
    have a shorter object file path, the object file paths (and all
    other related paths) will be constructed as following:
    If there's no two or more source files with the same base name:

    <bazel-bin>/<target_package_path>/_objs/<target_name>/<source_base
    _name>.<extension>
    otherwise:

    <bazel-bin>/<target_package_path>/_objs/<target_name>/N/<source_ba
    se_name>.<extension>
      N = the file?s order among the source files with the same
    basename, starts from 0.
  - Move (c/cxx)opts from legacy_compile_flags to user_compile_flags
  - CppRules: Remove optional_*_flag fields from CROSSTOOL, they are
    not
    used, and could be expressed using features.
  - Introduce --incompatible_disable_objc_provider_resources to turn
    off all resource-related fields of the Objc provider.
  - Removed the statement of "What does Bazel support?" as it's
    limiting/misleading. Added supported host OSes to
    "multi-platform" paragraph.
  - android_library AAR output now contains proguard.txt
  - Bazel now displays information about remote cache hits and
    execution strategies used in its UI after every build and test,
    and adds a corresponding line "process stats" to BuildToolLogs in
    BEP.
  - Print correct build result for builds with --aspects flag.
  - android_binary.manifest_merger is no longer supported.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - In order to access the template variables $(JAVA) and
    $(JAVABASE), @bazel_tools//tools/jdk:current_java_runtime needs
    to be added to the toolchains= attribute from now on.
  - The ctx.middle_man function is not supported anymore.
  - The flag --incompatible_list_plus_equals_inplace is removed, its
    default behavior is preserved. += on lists now always mutates the
    left hand
    side.
  - --android_sdk no longer supports filegroup targets.
  - android_* rules no longer support legacy_native_support attribute.

New features:

  - query: Add option --noproto:flatten_selects to turn off
    flattening of selector lists in proto output.
  - New android test rule, android_local_test.

Important changes:

  - The --remote_rest_cache flag now respects --remote_timeout.
  - --experimental_java_coverage is available for testing.
  - The deprecated builtin `set` is no longer allowed even from within
    unexecuted code in bzl files. It's temporarily possible to use
    --incompatible_disallow_uncalled_set_constructor=false if this
    change causes
    incompatibility issues.
  - Linkstamping is now a separate and full-blown CppCompileAction,
    it's
    no longer a part of linking command.
  - Using `+`, `|` or `.union` on depsets is now deprecated. Please
    use the new
      constructor instead (see
    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/depsets.html).
  - config_feature_flag's default_value is optional. It is
    only an error to have a config_feature_flag with no default_value
    if that config_feature_flag has not been set in the configuration
    it is being evaluated in.
  - --[no]keep_incrementality_data is gone, replaced by the
    enum-valued --incremental_state_retention_strategy
  - Linkstamping is now a separate and full-blown CppCompileAction,
    it's
    no longer a part of linking command.
  - Added --checkHashMismatch flag to ZipFilterAction. Valid values
    are IGNORE, WARN and ERROR. --errorOnHashMismatch is deprecated,
    please use this flag instead.
  - Set build jobs equivalent to number of logical processors by
    default. Should improve build times significantly.
  - Added --(no)expand_test_suites flag.
  - Rename --keep_incrementality_data to --track_incremental_state
  - --remote_rest_cache was renamed to --remote_http_cache. Both
    options keep working in this release, but --remote_rest_cache
    will be
    removed in the next release.
  - Aspects-on-aspect see and propagate over aspect attributes.
  - --auth_* flags were renamed to --google_* flags. The old names
    will continue to work for this release but will be removed in the
    next
    release.
  - Remote Caching and Execution support output directories.
  - Remove defunct flags
    --experimental_incremental_dexing_for_lite_proto and
    --experimental_incremental_dexing_error_on_missed_jars that have
    long been enabled by default
  - New version of aapt2 and Resources.proto.
  - Make PIC and non PIC outputs for C++ compilation with Tree
    Artifacts

```

Incompatible changes:

  - The deprecated `set` constructor is removed, along with the
    migration flag --incompatible_disallow_set_constructor. It is
    still temporarily
    allowed to refer to `set` from within unexecuted code.
  - The flag --incompatible_disallow_set_constructor is no longer
    available, the deprecated `set` constructor is not available
    anymore.
  - The path to the JVM executable is not accessible anymore as
    ctx.{fragments,host_fragments}.jvm.java_executable. Use
    JavaRuntimeInfo.java_executable_exec_path instead.
  - --clean_style is no longer an option.

New features:

  - Users can use win_def_file attribute to specify a DEF file for
    exporting symbols when build a shared library on Windows.
  - Add --experimental_android_resource_cycle_shrinking option to
    allow for more aggressive code and resource shrinking.

Important changes:

  - Late-bound attributes are exposed to skylark. This is a new API
    (`configuration_field()`) to depend on certain
    configuration-defined targets from skylark rules.
  - Document interaction between test_suite and target exclusions
  - AAR manifest files will come from the processed resource APK if it
    exists.
    RELNOTES: None for Blaze users.
  - Document interaction between test_suite and target exclusions
  - --keep_incrementality_data flag allows Bazel servers to be run in
    memory-saving non-incremental mode independent of --batch and
    --discard_analysis_cache.
  - Add deps attribute to Skylark maven_aar and maven_jar workspace
    rules.
  - Use --expand_configs_in_place as a startup argument to change the
    order in which --config expansions are interpreted.
  - SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
    (https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/) can
    be used to override the timestamp used for stamped target (when
    using --stamp).
  - Package specifications can now be prefixed with `-` to indicate
    negation
  - transitive_source_jars is now exposed on JavaInfo.
  - Add six to deps of has_services=1 py_proto_librarys.
  - java_tests no complain when use_testrunner is explicitly set to 1
    and main_class is set.
  - transitive_source_jars is now exposed on JavaInfo.
  - Debug messages generated by `print()` are not being filtered out
    by --output_filter anymore, it's recommended not to use them in
    production code.
  - in the Label() function, relative_to_caller_repository is now
    deprecated.
  - java_tests no complain when use_testrunner is explicitly set to 1
    and main_class is set.
  - Bazel's default hash function was changed from MD5 to SHA256.
    In particular, this affects users of remote caching and
    execution, as
    all hashes will be SHA256 by default.
  - Remove redirects for domains be.bazel.build and cr.bazel.build
    from the source for docs.bazel.build (because those subdomains
    don't resolve here; they resolve to bazel.build, which has the
    redirects for them)
  - First argument of 'load' must be a label. Path syntax is removed.
      (label should start with '//' or ':').
  - Document startup option --host_javabase
  - The --host_platform and --platform flags are no longer
    experimental.

Incompatible changes:

  - ctx.fragments.apple.{xcode_version,ios_minimum_os} is not
    supported anymore. The same information is accessible through the
    target @bazel_tools//tools/osx:current_xcode_config: point an
    implicit attribute to it (i.e.
    attr.label(default=Label("@bazel_tools//tools/osx:current_xcode_co
    nfig")) then use
    ctx.attr._xcode_config[apple_common].XcodeVersionConfig].
  - ctx.fragments.apple.minimum_os_for_platform_type is not supported
    anymore. The same information is accessible through the target
    @bazel_tools//tools/osx:current_xcode_config: point an implicit
    attribute to it (i.e.
    attr.label(default=Label("@bazel_tools//tools/osx:current_xcode_co
    nfig")) then use
    ctx.attr._xcode_config[apple_common].XcodeVersionConfig].minimum_o
    s_for_platform_type .
  - ctx.fragments.apple.sdk_version_for_platform is not supported
    anymore. The same information is accessible through the target
    @bazel_tools//tools/osx:current_xcode_config: point an implicit
    attribute to it (i.e.
    attr.label(default=Label("@bazel_tools//tools/osx:current_xcode_co
    nfig")) then use
    ctx.attr._xcode_config[apple_common].XcodeVersionConfig].sdk_versi
    on_for_platform .
  - --javabase=<absolute path> and --host_javabase=<absolute path>
    are not supported anymore. If you need this functionality
    java_runtime_suite(name="suite", default=":runtime")
    java_runtime(name="runtime", java_home=<path to the JDK>) is an
    alternative.
  - The flag --incompatible_descriptive_string_representations is no
    longer available, old style string representations of objects are
    not supported
    anymore.
  - The flag --incompatible_disallow_set_constructor is no longer
    available, the deprecated `set` constructor is not available
    anymore.
  - += on lists now mutates them. `list1 += list2` is now equivalent
    to `list1.extend(list2)` and not equivalent to `list1 = list1 +
    list2` anymore.
  - the target_apple_env and apple_host_system_env methods on
    ctx.fragments.apple are not supported anymore. The same
    information is accessible through apple_common.target_apple_env
    and apple_common.apple_host_system_env . They need the Xcode
    configuration as an argument, which can be obtained by declaring
    an implicit dependency on it (i.e.
    attr.label(default=Label("@bazel_tools//tools/osx:current_xcode_co
    nfig")) and then calling e.g.
    apple_common.apple_host_system_env(ctx.attr._xcode_config[apple_co
    mmon.XcodeVersionConfig]).
  - C++ toolchain identifiers are not in the name of the output
    directory anymore.
  - Selecting on "xcode_version" and
    "{ios,tvos,macos,watchos}_sdk_version" is not supported anymore.
    What was config_setting(values={"$FOO_version": $VALUE}) is now

New features:

  - runfiles, sh: Shell scripts may now depend on
    //src/tools/runfiles:runfiles_sh_lib and source runfiles.sh. The
    script defines the `rlocation` function which returns runfile
    paths on every platform.
  - In addition to $(location), Bazel now also supports $(rootpath)
    to obtain
        the root-relative path (i.e., for runfiles locations), and
    $(execpath) to
        obtain the exec path (i.e., for build-time locations)

Important changes:

  - android_binary now supports custom debug keys via the debug_key
    attribute.
  - Updated Android proguard to 5.3.3. It now works with android-24+.
  - --experimental_use_parallel_android_resource_processing and
    --experimental_android_use_nocompress_extensions_on_apk are
    removed. These features are fully rolled out.
  - Fixes #2574
  - Fixes #3834
  - Enable experimental UI by default.
  - .
    RELNOTES: None.
    RELNOTES: No.
  - Add memory profiler.
  - [Bazel] {java,cc}_proto_library now look for dependencies in
    @com_google_protobuf, instead of in @com_google_protobuf_$LANG
  - Improved merge.sh script in cookbook.
  - Fixing regression to --experimental_remote_spawn_cache
  - Support for linker scripts in NativeDepsHelper (e.g.,
    android_binary)
  - Skylark semantics flags now affect WORKSPACE files and repository
    rules.
  - ctx.outputs.executable is deprecated. Use DefaultInfo(executable
    = ...) instead.
  - Update "mirror.bazel.build" urls to use https.
  - Improve --config logging when --announce_rc is present.
  - Document interaction between test_suite and target exclusions
  - Replace version numbers for Bazel installers with "<version>"
    (because this will change often)
  - Published command lines should have improved lists of effective
    options.
  - --incremental_dexing_binary_types has been removed. All builds
    are supported by incremental dexing (modulo proguard and some
    blacklisted dx flags).
  - Document --host_javabase, --host_java_toolchain

```

Incompatible changes:

  - The --output=location flag to 'bazel query' cannot be used with
    query expressions that involve the 'buildfiles' or 'loadfiles'
    operators. This also applies to 'genquery' rules.
  - Operators for equality, comparison, 'in' and 'not in' are no
    longer associative,
      e.g.  x < y < z  is now a syntax error. Before, it was parsed
    as:  (x < y) < z.
  - In strings, octal sequences greater than \377 are now forbidden
    (e.g. "\\600").
      Previously, Blaze had the same behavior as Python 2, where
    "\\450" == "\050".
  - Using tabulation for identation is now fobidden in .bzl files
  - `load` is now a language keyword, it cannot be used as an
    identifier
  - lvalues must have define at least one variable (i.e. we forbid
    `[] = f()`).
  - Fixed a bug whereby multiple load() statements could appear on
    the same line
  - -extra_checks:off is no longer supported; use
    -XepDisableAllChecks instead
  - java_common.java_toolchain_attr is removed. Depend on the
    java_toolchain_alias() rule to accomplish the same thing.
  - cc_common.cc_toolchain_attr and java_common.java_runtime_attr are
    not supported anymore and were replaced with the
    cc_toolchain_alias() and java_runtime_alias() rules.
  - Noop flag --deprecated_generate_xcode_project deleted.
  - Objects in Skylark are converted to strings in a more descriptive
    and less harmful way (they don't leak information that shouldn't
    be accessed by Skylark code, e.g. nondeterministic memory addresses
    of objects).
  - `set` is deprecated in BUILD and .bzl files, please use `depset`
    instead. Ordering names have also been changed, please use "default",
    "postorder", "preorder", and "topological" instead of "stable",
    "compile", "naive_link", and "link" correspondingly.
  - Integer overflow (on signed 32 bit numbers) in BUILD/bzl files is
    an error.
  - Keyword-only syntax in a function definition is now forbidden
      e.g. `def foo(a, *, b)` or `def foo(a, *b, c)`
  - --incompatible_comprehension_variables_do_not_leak defaults to
    "true."
      Iteration variable becomes inaccessible after a list/dict
    comprehension.
  - @bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/docker:docker.bzl is no longer
    available, please see https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker.

New features:

  - Zipped LLVM profiles are now supported.
  - LIPO maps to ThinLTO for LLVM builds.
  - Change to handle LLVM FDO zipped profile contents correctly.
  - Do not disable fully dynamic linking with ThinLTO when invoked
    via LIPO options.
  - There is now a 'siblings' query function. See the query
    documentation for more details.
  - Added the print_action command, which outputs the
    actions needed to build a given target in the form of an
    ExtraActionSummary proto in text format.
  - android_binary now supports proguard_apply_dictionary to specify
    a custom dictionary to use for choosing names to obfuscate
    classes and members to.

Important changes:

  - Windows: bazel clean --expunge works
  - First argument of 'load' should be a label. Path syntax is
    deprecated (label should start with '//' or ':').
  - Octal prefix '0' is deprecated in favor of '0o' (use 0o777
    instead of 0777).
  - The extension_safe attribute of apple_binary no longer validates
    transitive dependencies are compiled against extension_safe APIs.
  - Parentheses around the tuple are now mandatory in [a for b in c
    if 1, 2]
  - Adjust the thresholds for --test_verbose_timeout_warnings so that
    it can recommending timeout increases and won't recommend
    timeouts that are too close to the actual timeout.
  - Iterating on a `depset` object is deprecated. If you need an
    iterable, call the `.to_list()` method first.
  - Bazel now uses tools from action_configs in Crosstool by default
    (as oposed to using top level tools).
  - Incremental dexing errors on combination of --multidex=off and
    either --main-dex-list or --minimal-main-dex.
  - When using the dictionary literal syntax, it is now an error to
    have duplicated keys (e.g.  {'ab': 3, 'ab': 5}).
  - New property on android_sdk: aapt2
      Choose the version of aapt on android_binary
  - Add idl_preprocessed attribute to android_library, so that
    preprocessed aidl files can be passed to android_library for
    compiling
  - Bazel's remote_worker backend for remote execution supports
    sandboxing on Linux now. Check
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/remote_w
    orker/README.md for details.
  - Allows flags that expand to take values.
  - Make querying attributes formed by selector lists of list types
    more efficient by no longer listing every possible combination of
    attribute value but by more compactly storing the possible values
    of the list.
  - writing build events to a file is no longer experimental
  - set --rewrite_calls_to_long_compare to false by default.
  - ObjC and C++ coverage feature is unified under name 'coverage'
  - Enable --incremental_dexing for Android builds by default. Note
    that some dexopts are incompatible with incremental dexing,
    including --force-jumbo.
  - Evaluation will soon use checked arithmetics and throw an error
    instead of overflow/underflow.
  - Implicit iteration in the CROSSTOOL has been removed, use
    explicit 'iterate_over' message.
  - Add option for Android specific grte_top
  - Crosstool patches are only applied if the toolchain doesn't define
    'no_legacy_features' feature.
  - 'platform_type' is now a mandatory attribute on apple_binary and
    apple_static_library rules.
    If this change breaks your build, feel free to add platform_type
    = 'ios' to any apple_binary and apple_static_library
    targets in your project, as this was the previous default
    behavior.
  - Remove apple_watch2_extension build rule. Users should be using
    the skylark watchos_application and watchos_extension rules.
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple has details.
  - Check stderr to detect if connected to a terminal.  Deprecate
    --isatty.
  - Commands that shut down the server (like "shutdown") now ensure
    that the server process has terminated before the client process
    terminates.
  - Remove apple_watch1_extension and apple_watch_extension_binary
    rules. Users should be using the skylark watchos_application and
    watchos_extension rules.
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple has details.
  - Windows: Wrapper-less CROSSTOOL becomes default now.
    set USE_MSVC_WRAPPER=1 if you still want to use wrapper script.
  - Ignore --glibc in the Android transition.
  - Remove --experimental_android_use_singlejar_for_multidex.
  - nocopts now also filter copts
  - 'strip' action is now configured via feature configuration
  - The Build Event Service (BES) client now properly supports
    Google Applicaton Default Credentials.
  - Flags from action_config get added first to the command line
    first, before the flags from features.
  - update dexing tools to Android SDK 26.0.1
  - Bazel Android support now requires build-tools 26.0.1 or later.
  - `bazel info output_path` no longer relies on the root directory
    filename being equal to the workspace name.
  - The `print` function now prints debug messages instead of
    warnings.
  - speedup of incremental dexing tools
  - --announce_rc now controls whether bazelrc startup options are
    printed to stderr.
  - Removing a few unused objc_provider keys.
  - Improved logging when workers have to be restarted due to its
    files having changed.
  - Top-level `if` statements are now forbidden.
  - Java protos are compiled to Java 7 bytecode.
  - All Android builds now use the desugar tool to support some Java
    8 features by default. To disable, use the --nodesugar_for_android flag.
  - Skylark-related options may now appear as "common" command
    options in the .bazelrc
  - Python is now required to build bazel.
  - New --build_runfile_manifests flag controls production of
    runfiles manifests.
  - Enable debug info for Java builds
  - Allow java_lite_proto_library in the deps of android rules.
  - .so files in APKs will be memory-page aligned when
    android_binary.nocompress_extensions contains ".so" and
    --experimental_android_use_nocompress_extensions_on_apk is
    specified.
  - Skylark providers can specify allowed fields and their
    documentation.
  - Support ctx.actions.args() for more efficient Skylark command
    line construction.
  - The remote HTTP/1.1 caching client (--remote_rest_cache) now
    distinquishes between action cache and CAS. The request URL for
    the action cache is prefixed with 'ac' and the URL for the CAS
    is prefixed with 'cas'.
  - `JavaInfo` is a preferred alias to `java_common.provider`.
  - J2ObjC version updated to 2.0.3.
  - A new Java coverage implementation is available. Makes possible
    coverage for Skylark JVM rules.
  - Make proguard_apply_dictionary also apply to class and package
    obfuscation, not just class members.
  - android_binary.nocompress_extensions now applies to all files in
    the APK, not just resources and assets.
  - The apple_genrule rule that is distributed with Bazel has been
    deleted. Users who wish to use genrules with Xcode's
    DEVELOPER_DIR set should use the rules in
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple instead.
  - The swift_library rule that is distributed with Bazel has been
    deleted. Users who wish to compile Swift should use the rules in
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple instead.
  - The Build Event Protocol's File.uri field is now properly
    encoded according to RFC2396.
  - Deprecated: Using the android_library.deps attribute to
    implicitly export targets to dependent rules. If your code is
    using this feature, Bazel will raise a warning. To fix, please
    use android_library.exports to explicitly specify exported
    targets. Run with
    --experimental_allow_android_library_deps_without_srcs=false to
    ensure forward compatibility when this feature is removed in a
    future release.
  - java_common.create_provider is now supported with creating ijars
    by default. This introduces incompatibilities for existing users.
    Please set use_ijar=False if you don't want to use ijars.
  - Tests can now write files to TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR and
    TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_ANNOTATIONS_DIR and these will be
    reflected under bazel-testlogs.
  - remove unused --host_incremental_dexing flag
  - Stop using --undefined dynamic_lookup in Apple links. Enables
    unresolved symbol errors.
  - All test output files included for cached, uncached, and multiple
    attempt tests.
  - Android rules no longer restrict the manifest file to be named
    "AndroidManifest.xml".
  - Boolean flag values will now get normalized to 1 or 0 in
    canonicalize-flags output.
  - added experimental --use_new_category_enum to the help command to
    output options grouped by the new type of category.
  - Expose output jars and jdeps in java_common.provider, when
    available.
  - android_library targets are no longer allowed to use deps to
    export targets implicitly; please use android_library.exports
    instead.
  - New depset API
  - apple_binary and apple_static_library no longer support
    compilation attributes such as 'srcs'. If this breaks any
    existing targets, you may migrate all such attributes to a new
    objc_library target and depend on that objc_library target via
    the 'deps' attribute of apple_binary or apple_static_library.

Incompatible changes:

  - Noop flag --deprecated_generate_xcode_project deleted.
  - Objects in Skylark are converted to strings in a more descriptive
    and less harmful way (they don't leak information that shouldn't
    be accessed by Skylark code, e.g. nondeterministic memory addresses
    of objects).
  - `set` is deprecated in BUILD and .bzl files, please use `depset`
    instead. Ordering names have also been changed, please use
    "default", "postorder", "preorder", and "topological" instead of

    documentation for more details.
  - Added the print_action command, which outputs the
    actions needed to build a given target in the form of an
    ExtraActionSummary proto in text format.
  - android_binary now supports proguard_apply_dictionary to specify
    a custom dictionary to use for choosing names to obfuscate
    classes and members to.

Important changes:

  - 'strip' action is now configured via feature configuration
  - Flags from action_config get added first to the command line
    first,
    before the flags from features.
  - `bazel info output_path` no longer relies on the root directory
    filename being equal to the workspace name.
  - The `print` function now prints debug messages instead of

    runfiles manifests.
  - Enable debug info for Java builds

```

Incompatible changes:

  - The --output=location flag to 'bazel query' cannot be used with
    query expressions that involve the 'buildfiles' or 'loadfiles'
    operators. This also applies to 'genquery' rules.
  - Operators for equality, comparison, 'in' and 'not in' are no
    longer associative, e.g.  x < y < z  is now a syntax error.
    Before, it was parsed as:  (x < y) < z.
  - In strings, octal sequences greater than \377 are now forbidden
    (e.g. "\\600"). Previously, Blaze had the same behavior as Python 2,
    where "\\450" == "\050".
  - Using tabulation for identation is now fobidden in .bzl files
  - `load` is now a language keyword, it cannot be used as an
    identifier
  - lvalues must have define at least one variable (i.e. we forbid
    `[] = f()`).
  - Fixed a bug whereby multiple load() statements could appear on
    the same line
  - -extra_checks:off is no longer supported; use
    -XepDisableAllChecks instead
  - java_common.java_toolchain_attr is removed. Depend on the
    java_toolchain_alias() rule to accomplish the same thing.
  - cc_common.cc_toolchain_attr and java_common.java_runtime_attr are
    not supported anymore and were replaced with the
    cc_toolchain_alias() and java_runtime_alias() rules.

New features:

  - Zipped LLVM profiles are now supported.
  - LIPO maps to ThinLTO for LLVM builds.
  - Change to handle LLVM FDO zipped profile contents correctly.

Important changes:

  - Windows: bazel clean --expunge works
  - First argument of 'load' should be a label. Path syntax is
    deprecated (label should start with '//' or ':').
  - Octal prefix '0' is deprecated in favor of '0o' (use 0o777
    instead of 0777).
  - The extension_safe attribute of apple_binary no longer validates
    transitive dependencies are compiled against extension_safe APIs.
  - Parentheses around the tuple are now mandatory in [a for b in c
    if 1, 2]
  - Adjust the thresholds for --test_verbose_timeout_warnings so that
    it can recommending timeout increases and won't recommend
    timeouts that are too close to the actual timeout.
  - Iterating on a `depset` object is deprecated. If you need an
    iterable, call the `.to_list()` method first.
  - Bazel now uses tools from action_configs in Crosstool by default
    (as oposed to using top level tools).
  - Incremental dexing errors on combination of --multidex=off and
    either --main-dex-list or --minimal-main-dex.
  - When using the dictionary literal syntax, it is now an error to
    have duplicated keys (e.g.  {'ab': 3, 'ab': 5}).
  - New property on android_sdk: aapt2
      Choose the version of aapt on android_binary
  - Add idl_preprocessed attribute to android_library, so that
    preprocessed aidl files can be passed to android_library for
    compiling
  - Bazel's remote_worker backend for remote execution supports
    sandboxing on Linux now. Check
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/tools/remote_w
    orker/README.md for details.
  - Allows flags that expand to take values.
  - Make querying attributes formed by selector lists of list types
    more efficient by no longer listing every possible combination of
    attribute value but by more compactly storing the possible values
    of the list.
  - Writing build events to a file is no longer experimental
  - set --rewrite_calls_to_long_compare to false by default.
  - ObjC and C++ coverage feature is unified under name 'coverage'
  - Enable --incremental_dexing for Android builds by default. Note
    that some dexopts are incompatible with incremental dexing,
    including --force-jumbo.
  - Evaluation will soon use checked arithmetics and throw an error
    instead of overflow/underflow.
  - Implicit iteration in the CROSSTOOL has been removed, use
    explicit 'iterate_over' message.
  - Add option for Android specific grte_top
  - Crosstool patches are only applied if the toolchain doesn't define
    'no_legacy_features' feature.
  - 'platform_type' is now a mandatory attribute on apple_binary and
    apple_static_library rules.
    If this change breaks your build, feel free to add platform_type
    = 'ios' to any apple_binary and apple_static_library
    targets in your project, as this was the previous default
    behavior.
  - Remove apple_watch2_extension build rule. Users should be using
    the skylark watchos_application and watchos_extension rules.
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple has details.
  - Check stderr to detect if connected to a terminal.  Deprecate
    --isatty.
  - Commands that shut down the server (like "shutdown") now ensure
    that the server process has terminated before the client process
    terminates.
  - Remove apple_watch1_extension and apple_watch_extension_binary
    rules. Users should be using the skylark watchos_application and
    watchos_extension rules.
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple has details.
  - Windows: Wrapper-less CROSSTOOL becomes default now.
    set USE_MSVC_WRAPPER=1 if you still want to use wrapper script.

Incompatible changes:

  - Blaze no longer generates xcode projects. Use tulsi.bazel.build
    instead.

Important changes:

  - Keyword-only syntax in a function definition is deprecated
      (e.g. `def foo(a, *, b)` or `def foo(a, *b, c)`) and will be
    removed in the future.
  - Attempting to build an Android target without setting up
    android_sdk_repository will now produce a helpful error message.
  - Adds a sha256 attribute to git_repository and new_git_repository.
    This can only be used if the remote is a public GitHub
    repository. It forces
    Bazel to download the repository as a tarball, which will often
    be faster and
    more robust than cloning it.
  - Sandboxing is now enabled by default on FreeBSD (via
    processwrapper-sandbox).
  - android_test may use manifest placeholders with 'manifest_merger
    = "android"'.
  - load() statements should be called at the top of .bzl files,
    before any
      other statement. This convention will be enforced in the future.
  - Effectively remove sysroot from CppConfiguration and allow it to
    use select statements.
  - proto_library.strict_proto_deps no longer exists.
  - Flag --explicit_jre_deps is now a noop.
  - The 'legacy' Android manifest merger is deprecated. Please
    upgrade to the 'android' manifest merger, which is the same
    merger used by Gradle.
    https://developer.android.com/studio/build/manifest-merge.html
  - Using $(CC_FLAGS) in a GenRule adds a dependency to the c++
    toolchain
  - add one-version enforcement to android_local_test
  - Skylark support (apple_common.dotted_version(string)) for
    building DottedVersion objects to interface with native apple
    rules
  - CC_FLAGS can be defined using 'cc-flags-make-variable' action_config in
    CROSSTOOL
  - ios_framework native rule has been removed. This rule had been
    essentially broken for several months now; users should be using
    the skylark ios framework rule.
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple has details.
  - Clean command no longer uses boolean values for --async,
    --expunge, and --expunge_async options.
  - Partially fixes external J2ObjC support.
  - '--aspects' can occur more than once on the command line.
  - --no_ prefix no longer recognized.
  - Use action_config in crosstool for static library archiving,
    remove ar_flag.
  - Added a new flag --sandbox_writable_path, which asks the sandbox
    to
    make an existing directory writable when running actions.
  - bazel test now also computes a default instrumentation filter if
    --collect_code_coverage is enabled
  - n/na
  - In .bzl files, top-level `if` statements are deprecated and will
    be forbidden
      in the future. Move them in a function body instead (or use a
    conditional
      expression instead: `x if condition else y`).
  - ios_device and ios_test are deprecated. Please use the new testing
    rules in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple instead.
  - bazel query --output package now displays packages from external
    repository with the format "@reponame//package". Packages in the
    main repository continue to have the format "package".
  - ctx.expand_make_variables is deprecated.
  - Bazel posts links to the CAS to the BEP if remote caching /
    execution is enabled
  - `bazel info execution_root` returns the corrrect directory name
    for the execution root.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel's Linux sandbox no longer mounts an empty tmpfs on /tmp,
    instead the existing /tmp is mounted read-write. If you prefer
    to have a tmpfs on /tmp for sandboxed actions for increased
    hermeticity, please use the flag --sandbox_tmpfs_path=/tmp.
  - Converting artifacts to strings and printing them now return
    "File" instead of "Artifact" to be consistent with the type name.
  - The return type of depset.to_list() is now a list rather than a
    frozen list. (Modifying the list has no effect on the depset.)
  - Bazel now prints logs in single lines to java.log
  - --use_dash, --dash_url and --dash_secret are removed.
  - Remote repositories must define any remote repositories they
    themselves use (e.g., if @x//:foo depends on @y//:bar, @y must be
    defined
    in @x's WORKSPACE file).
  - Remote repositories must define any remote repositories they
    themselves use (e.g., if @x//:foo depends on @y//:bar, @y must be
    defined
    in @x's WORKSPACE file).
  - objc_xcodeproj has been removed, use tulsi.bazel.build instead.

New features:

  - If grte_top is a label, it can now follow non-configurable
    redirects.
  - Optional coverage_files attribute to cc_toolchain
  - "query --output=build" now includes select()s
  - Raw LLVM profiles are now supported.

Important changes:

  - Automatically generate Proguard mapping when resource shrinking
    and Proguard are enabled.
  - New rules in Bazel: proto_library, java_lite_proto_library,
    java_proto_library and cc_proto_library
  - Activate the "dead_strip" feature if objc binary stripping is
    enabled.
  - More stable naming scheme for lambda classes in desugared android
    code
  - Convert --use_action_cache to a regular option
  - Per-architecture dSYM binaries are now propagated by
    apple_binary's AppleDebugOutputsProvider.
  - Avoid factory methods when desugaring stateless lambdas for
    Android
  - desugar calls to Objects.requireNonNull(Object o) with
    o.getClass() for android
  - Add an --copy_bridges_from_classpath argument to android
    desugaring tool
  - Change how desugar finds desugared classes to have it working on
    Windows
  - Evaluation of commands on TargetsBelowDirectory patterns
    (e.g. //foo/...) matching packages that fail to load now report
    more
    detailed error messages in keep_going mode.
  - Allow to have several inputs and outputs
  - Repository context's execute() function can print stdout/stderr
    while running. To enable, pass quiet=False.
  - Bazel can now be built with a bundled version of the OpenJDK.
    This makes it possible to use Bazel on systems without a JDK, or
    where
    the installed JDK is too old.
  - The --jobs flag now defaults to "auto", which causes Bazel to
    use a reasonable degree of parallelism based on the local
    machine's
    capacity.
  - Bazel benchmark (perf.bazel.build) supports Java and Cpp targets.
  - no factory methods generated for lambda expressions on android
  - The Linux sandbox no longer changes the user to 'nobody' by
    default, instead the current user is used as is. The old behavior
    can be
    restored via the --sandbox_fake_username flag.
  - /tmp and /dev/shm are now writable by default inside the
    Linux sandbox.
  - Bazel can now use the process-wrapper + symlink tree based
    sandbox implementation in FreeBSD.
  - turn on --experimental_incremental_dexing_error_on_missed_jars by
    default.
  - All android_binarys are now signed with both Apk Signature V1 and
    V2. See https://source.android.com/security/apksigning/v2.html
    for more details.
  - Windows MSVC wrappers: Not filtering warning messages anymore,
    use --copt=-w and --host_copt=-w to suppress them.
  - A downloader bug was fixed that prevented RFC 7233 Range
    connection resumes from working with certain HTTP servers
  - Introduces experimental android_device rule for configuring and
    launching Android emulators.
  - For boolean flags, setting them to false using --no_<flag_name>
    is deprecated. Use --no<flag_name> without the underscore, or
    --<flag_name>=false instead.
  - Add --experimental_android_compress_java_resources flag to store
    java
    resources as compressed inside the APK.
  - Removed --experimental_use_jack_for_dexing and libname.jack
    output of
    android_library.
  - blaze canonicalize-flags now takes a --show_warnings flag
  - Changing --invocation_policy will no longer force a server
    restart.
  - Bazel now supports Android NDK14.
  - android_binary multidex should now work without additional flags.
  - Use action_config in crosstool for static library archiving,
    remove ar_flag.
  - new option for bazel canonicalize-flags, --canonicalize_policy
  - Use action_config in crosstool for static library archiving,
    remove ar_flag.
  - android_library exports_manifest now defaults to True.
  - Fix select condition intersections.
  - Adds a --override_repository option that takes a repository
    name and path. This forces Bazel to use the directory at that path
    for the repository. Example usage:
    `--override_repository=foo=/home/user/gitroot/foo`.
  - fix idempotency issue with desugaring lambdas in interface
    initializers for android
  - --experimental_android_use_singlejar_for_multidex is now a no-op
    and will eventually be removed.
  - Every local_repository now requires a WORKSPACE file.
  - Remove jack and jill attributes of the android_sdk rule.
  - Add Skylark stubs needed to remove sysroot from CppConfiguration.
  - Desugar try-with-resources so that this language feature is
    available
    to deveces with API level under 19.
  - The flag --worker_max_retries was removed. The
    WorkerSpawnStrategy no longer retries execution of failed Spawns,
    the reason being that this just masks compiler bugs and isn't
    done for any other execution strategy either.
  - Bazel will no longer gracefully restart workers that crashed /
    quit, instead this triggers a build failure.
  - All java resources are now compressed in android_binary APKs by
    default.
  - All java resources are now compressed in android_binary APKs by
    default.
  - android_ndk_repository now creates a cc_library
    (@androidndk//:cpufeatures) for the cpufeatures library that is
    bundled in the Android NDK. See
    https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpu-features.html for
    more details.
  - 'output_groups' and 'instrumented_files' cannot be specified in
    DefaultInfo.
  - You can increase the CPU reservation for tests by adding a
    "cpu:<n>" (e.g. "cpu:4" for four cores) tag to their rule in a
    BUILD file. This can be used if tests would otherwise overwhelm
    your system if there's too much parallelism.
  - Deprecate use_singlejar_for_proguard_libraryjars and force
    behavior to always on.

```

Incompatible changes:

  - Depsets (former sets) are converted to strings as "depset(...)"
    instead of
    "set(...)".
  - Using --symlink_prefix is now applied to the output
    symlink (e.g. bazel-out) and the exec root symlink (e.g.
    bazel-workspace).
  - Bazel now uses the test's PATH for commands specified as
        --run_under; this can affect users who explicitly set PATH to
    a more
        restrictive value than the default, which is to forward the
    local PATH
  - It's not allowed anymore to compare objects of different types
    (i.e. a string to an integer) and objects for which comparison
    rules are not
    defined (i.e. a dict to another dict) using order operators.

New features:

  - environ parameter to the repository_rule function let
    defines a list of environment variables for which a change of
    value
    will trigger a repository refetching.

Important changes:

  - android_ndk_repository now supports Android NDK R13.
  - Android resource shrinking is now available for android_binary
    rules. To enable, set the attribute 'shrink_resources = 1'. See
    https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/be/android.html#android_b
    inary.shrink_resources.
  - resolve_command/action's input_manifest return/parameter is now
    list
  - For increased compatibility with environments where UTS
    namespaces are not available, the Linux sandbox no longer hides
    the hostname of the local machine by default. Use
    --sandbox_fake_hostname to re-enable this feature.
  - proto_library: alias libraries produce empty files for descriptor
    sets.
  - Adds pkg_rpm rule for generating RPM packages.
  - Allow CROSSTOOL files to have linker flags specific to static
    shared libraries.
  - Make it mandatory for Java test suites in bazel codebase, to
    contain at least one test.
  - Support for Java 8 lambdas, method references, type annotations
    and repeated annotations in Android builds with
    --experimental_desugar_for_android.
  - Removed .xcodeproj automatic output from objc rules. It can still
    be generated by requesting it explicitly on the command line.
  - Flips --explicit_jre_deps flag on by default.
  - Activate the "dbg", "fastbuild", and "opt" features in the objc
    CROSSTOOL.
  - Remove support for configuring JDKs with filegroups; use
    java_runtime and java_runtime_suite instead
  - android_ndk_repository api_level attribute is now optional. If not
    specified, the highest api level in the ndk/platforms directory
    is used.

Incompatible changes:

  - Only targets with public visibility can be bound to something in
    //external: .
  - The deprecated -x startup option has been removed.
  - docker_build: change the repository names embedded by
    docker_build. You can revert to the old behavior by setting
    legacy_repository_naming=True.
  - The string methods strip(), lstrip(), and rstrip() now
    by default remove the same whitespace characters as Python 3
    does, and accept
    None as an argument.
  - Deprecated globals HOST_CFG and DATA_CFG are removed. Use strings
    "host" and "data" instead.
  - repository_ctx environment is now affected by --action_env flag
    (value from the
    client environment will be replaced by value given on the command
    line through --action_env).
  - All executable labels must also have a cfg parameter specified.
  - Removed the cmd_helper.template function.
      The function was equivalent to:
        def template(items, template):
          return [template.format(path = i.path, short_path =
    i.short_path)
                    for i in items]
  - Tuples that end with a trailing comma must now be inside parens,
      e.g. (1,) instead of 1,
  - The traversal orders for depsets have been renamed. The old names
    are deprecated and will be removed in the future. New names:
    "stable" -> "default", "compile" -> "postorder", "link" ->
    "topological", "naive_link" -> "preorder".

New features:

  - Skylark: you can now multiply a list by an integer to get the
    concatenation of N copies of this list, e.g. [a,b] * 3 =
    [a,b,a,b,a,b]
  - Allow Android aidl tool to add a jar to the program's classpath,
    such as if needed to support generated sources.
  - Add transitive proguard_specs when android_sdk.aidl_lib is
    specified
  - Windows: "/dev/null" is now a supported path, e.g.
    --bazelrc=/dev/null now works

Important changes:

  - Bazel Android builds use the apksigner tool from the Android SDK
    build-tools. Bazel Android builds now require build-tools version
    24.0.3 or
    later.
  - Android SDK external bindings for support libraries, e.g.
    //external:android/appcompat_v4, are removed because the support
    library JARs that they referenced no longer ship with the Android
    SDK.
  - aar_import rule is now documented.
  - An IE bug was fixed in repository_ctx.download_and_extract
  - Update "-I" to "-isystem" in documentation to reflect current
    behavior.
  - android_sdk_repository build_tools_version is now optional. The
    highest installed build-tools will be used if none is specified.
  - New flag --sandbox_add_mount_pair to specify customized
    source:target path pairs to bind mount inside the sandbox.
  - expose proto_library descriptor set to skylark via
    <dep>.proto.descriptor_set
  - The `set` constructor is deprecated in favor of `depset`
  - Autodetect gold linker in cc_configure.bzl
  - Remove build flag --experimental_j2objc_annotation_processing. It
    is on by default now.
  - Set clang's -mwatchos-version-min correctly using the value of
    --watchos_minimum_os, not --watchos_sdk_version.
  - singlejar can now create jar files larger than 4GB.
  - android_sdk_repository and android_ndk_repository now read
    $ANDROID_HOME and $ANDROID_NDK_HOME if the path attribute is not
    set.
  - Removed broken api levels 3, 4 and 5 from Android NDK 12.
  - Default --android_dynamic_mode to off.
  - android_sdk_repository no longer requires api_level. If one is
    not specified, the highest android platform installed will be
    used. Furthermore, android_sdk's are created for all android
    platforms installed and can be specified with the --android_sdk
    flag.
  - To iterate over or test for membership in a set, prefer using the
    new to_list() method. E.g., "for x in myset.to_list():", or
    "print(x in myset.to_list())". Iteration/membership-test on the
    raw set itself is deprecated.
  - Remove support for --javawarn; use e.g. --javacopt=-Xlint:all
    instead

    so it can be checked into your workspace.
  - --{no}experimental_use_rclass_generator is now a nop.

New features:

Important changes:

  - Enable fallback URLs in Skylark http rules.
  - cc_proto_library generates C++ code from proto_library rules.
  - cc_library now supports the strip_prefix and strip_include_prefix
    attributes for control of include paths.
  - Skylark dicts internally don't rely on keys order anymore and
    accept any hashable values (i.e. structs with immutable values)
    as keys. Iteration order of dictionaries is no longer specified.

Incompatible changes:

  - Callback functions in Skylark no longer support the cfg
    parameter. This is a cleanup and only affects the signatures of
    callbacks, since the parameter hasn't been set since September
    2016.

Important changes:

  - Alias proto_library's produce a descriptor set that contains all
    srcs of its dependencies.
  - proto_library supports strict proto deps.
  - Top level @androidsdk support library targets have been replaced

```

New features:

  - android_library now has a "exported_plugins" attribute just like
    java_library
  - Use --strict_system_includes to apply hdrs_check=strict also to
        cc_library.includes, even if sandboxing is disabled.
  - Bazel on Windows: java_binary can now be the executable of
    Skylark rule actions (ctx.action's executable argument)
  - Packages are defined in BUILD.bazel as well as BUILD files.

Important changes:

  - getattr()'s 3-arg form no longer raises an error when the
    retrieved field is a built-in method.
  - --apk_signing_method default changed to v1. Android APKs are now
    signed with the new ApkSignerTool by default.
  - New rule: proto_lang_toolchain(), to support LANG_proto_library
    rules on multiple platforms.
  - Fix for Android clang++ std::stack segfault on 32bit x86. See
    https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=220159
  - Default android_manifest_merger is now "android" which uses the
    official Android manifest merger.
    http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide/man
    ifest-merger
  - Do not propagate aspect to its own attributes when using '*'.
  - Comparing sets (`if set1 < set2:`) is not allowed anymore in
    Skylark because it didn't work correctly anyway.
  - When --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only, Bazel reports
    extra-actions for actions registered by Aspects injected by a
    top-level rule (approximately).
  - Blacklists for proto_lang_toolchain() no longer have to be
    proto_library's.
  - Extra actions now contain aspect-related information.
  - Fix slicing bug where "abc"[:-4:-1] would give wrong answer

   + 9b1dfb8: Remove .sig file before gpg signing
   + 81aede1: Reimplement whole archive on Windows
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Skylark: updating list/dicts while they are being looped over is not
    allowed. Use an explicit copy if needed ("for x in list(mylist):").
  - Bazel now uses the --cpu flag to look up Jvms; it falls back
    to "default" if it can't find a Jvm matching the CPU value.
  - --command_port=-1 to use AF_UNIX for client/server communications
    is not supported anymore.
  - Sandboxed actions can access the network by default, unless their
    target has a "block-network" tag.

New features:

  - Files now have an "extension" property in Skylark.

Important changes:

  - Added a new flag --sandbox_tmpfs_path, which asks the sandbox to
    mount an empty, writable directory at a specified path when
    running actions. (Supported on Linux only for now.)
  - Update protoc-3.0.0-mingw.exe to a working (statically linked)
    binary
  - apple_static_library rule to create multi-architecture static
    archive files from Objc/C++/Swift dependencies on apple platforms
  - JS: Add support for localization with closure managed rules.
  - Create a flag --android_dynamic_mode to turn off dynamic mode
    during the Android split transition.
  - Darwin sandboxing is default.
  - Remove flag --experimental_zip_tree_artifact from j2objc Java
    annotation processing support.
  - A few functions are added to BUILD files for consistency (hash,
    dir,
      hasattr, getattr) with .bzl files, although they are not very
    useful.
  - --watchfs is now a command option; the startup option of the same
        name is deprecated. I.e., use bazel build --watchfs, not
    blaze --watchfs
        build.

   + ffdc05d: Add action_config and feature for linking on Windows
```

Incompatible changes:

  - If you maintain a rule that uses persistent workers, you'll have
    to specify execution_requirements={"supports-workers": 1} in the
    ctx.action that intends to run a tool with workers. The
    WorkerSpawnStrategy will alert you with a warning message if you
    forget to make this change and fallback to non-worker based
    execution.
  - It is now an error to include a precompiled library (.a, .lo, .so)
    in a cc_library which would generate a library with the same name
    (e.g., libfoo.so in cc_library foo) if that library also contains
    other linkable
    sources.
  - The main repository's execution root is under the main
    repository's workspace name, not the source directory's basename.
    This shouldn't
    have any effect on most builds, but it's possible it could break
    someone doing
    weird things with paths in actions.
  - Blaze doesn't support Unix domain sockets for communication
    between its client and server anymore. Therefore, the
    --command_port command line argument doesn't accept -1 as a valid
    value anymore.
  - Skylark: It is an error to shadow a global variable with a local
    variable after the global has already been accessed in the
    function.
  - bin_dir and genfiles_dir are now properties of ctx, not
    configuration. That is, to access the bin or genfiles directory
    from a
    Skylark rule, use ctx.bin_dir or ctx.genfiles_dir (not
    ctx.configuration.{bin,genfiles}_dir).  At the moment, you can
    access
    {bin,genfiles}_dir from either, but the ctx.configuration version
    will
    stop working in a future release.
  - filegroup-based C++ toolchains are not supported anymore.
    --*_crosstool_top options must always point to a
    cc_toolchain_suite rule (or an alias of one).
  - repository_ctx.{download,download_and_extract,execute} API now use
                   named parameters for optional parameters and no
    longer uses argument
                   type to distinguished between arguments
    (executable attribute name
                   must be specified when preceding optional
    arguments are missing).

New features:

  - print and fail are now available in BUILD files.

Important changes:

  - Added @bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo/git.bzl as a Skylark
    rule for Git repositories.
  - Added @bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo/maven_rules.bzl as a
    Skylark rule for Maven repositories.
  - Add global hash() function for strings (only)
  - Improve Android split transition handling.
  - Removes exports_manifest attribute from android_binary rule.
  - java_proto_library: control strict-deps through a rule-level and
    a package-level attribute.
  - Persistent workers are now used by default for Java compilation
    in Bazel, which should speed up your Java builds by ~4x. You can
    switch back to the old behavior via --strategy=Javac=standalone.
    Check out http://www.bazel.io/blog/2015/12/10/java-workers.html
    for more details.
  - objc_* rules can now depend on any target that returns an "objc"
    provider.
  - Adds support for NDK12 to `android_ndk_repository` rule in Bazel.
  - Test targets can disable the JUnit4 test security manager via a
    property.
  - Disable the Android split transition if --android_cpu and
    fat_apk_cpu are both empty.
  - New sandboxing implementation for Linux in which all actions run
    in a separate execroot that contains input files as symlinks back
    to the originals in the workspace. The running action now has
    read-write access to its execroot and /tmp only and can no longer
    write in arbitrary other places in the file system.
  - Add worker support to single jar.
  - Invoke source jar action as a worker.
  - Sandboxed builds allow network access for builds by default.
    Tests will still be run without networking, unless
    "requires-network" is specified as a tag.
  - Add path.realpath() method for Skylark repositories.
  - On Mac devices, detect locally installed versions of xcode to:
     1. Use a sensible default if xcode is required but
    --xcode_version is unspecified.
     2. Use sensible default iOS SDK version for the targeted version
    of xcode if ios_sdk_version is unspecified.
  - Emacs' [C-x `], a.k.a. next-error, works again in emacsen >= 25.1
  - swift_library can be used to build watchOS apps.
  - Exposes the is_device field on Apple platform objects and adds
    the apple_common.platform_type(name) method to retrieve a
    platform_type value that can be passed to methods like the Apple
    fragment's multi_arch_platform.
  - Move Skylark git_repository rules to git.bzl
  - Add support for aspects to attr.label() attributes
  - Global varaiables HOST_CFG and DATA_CFG are deprecated in favor
    of strings "host"
    and "data.
    Argument `cfg = "host"` or `cfg = "data"` is mandatory if
    `executable = True` is provided for a label.
  - The deprecation attribute of all rules now causes warnings
    to be printed when other targets depend on a target with that
    attribute set.
  - Change default of --[no]instrument_test_targets to false, change
    default --instrumentation_filter (which previously tried to
    exclude test targets by heuristic) to only exclude targets in
    javatests.
  - Remove deprecated absolute paths in blaze IDE artifacts
  - When using android_binary.manifest_merger="android" the merger
    produces a summary log next to the merged manifest artifact.
  - Allow different default mallocs per configuration.

              them changes.
   + 5a9c6b4: JavaBuilder: Reintroduce the -extra_checks flag.
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Removed predefined Python variable "generic_cpu".
  - Skylark rules: if you set "outputs" or an attribute to a
    function, this function must now list its required attributes as
    parameters (instead of an attribute map).
  - The host_platform and target_platform entries are not written to
    the master log anymore.
  - Bazel requires Hazelcast 3.6 or higher now for remote execution
    support, because we upgraded our client library and the protocol
    it uses is incompatible with older versions.

New features:

  - LIPO context (--lipo_context) can now also be a cc_test (in
    addition to cc_binary)

Important changes:

  - If --android_crosstool_top is set, native code compiled for
    android will always use --android_compiler and not --compiler in
    choosing the crosstool toolchain, and will use --android_cpu if
    --fat_apk_cpu is not set.
  - Add --instrument_test_targets option.
  - apple_binary supports a new platform_type attribute, which, if
    set to "watchos", will build dependencies for Apple's watchOS2.
  - objc_binary now supports late-loaded dynamic frameworks.
  - Native Swift rules no longer pull in module maps unconditionally.
    Use --experimental_objc_enable_module_maps for that.
  - Merged manifests are guaranteed to have the application element
    as the last child of the manifest element as required by Android
    N.
  - The Android manifest merger is now available as an option for
    android_binary rules. The merger will honor tools annotations in
    AndroidManifest.xml and will perform placeholder substitutions
    using the values specified in android_binary.manifest_values. The
    merger may be selected by setting the manifest_merger attribute
    on android_binary.
  - The progress message would not clear packages that need to be
    loaded twice.
  - Remove warning for high value of --jobs.
  - Use the correct build configuration for shared native deps during
    Android split transitions.
  - When building ObjectiveC++, pass the flag -std=gnu++11.
  - use xcrun simctl instead of iossim to launch the app for "blaze
    run".
  - Glob arguments 'exclude' and 'exclude_directories' must be named
  - Bazel no longer regards an empty file as changed if its mtime has
    changed.

Cherry picks:
   + ff30a73: Turn --legacy_external_runfiles back on by default
   + aeee3b8: Fix delete[] warning on fsevents.cc
```

Incompatible changes:

  - The --cwarn command line option is not supported anymore. Use
    --copt instead.

New features:

  - On OSX, --watchfs now uses FsEvents to be notified of changes
    from the filesystem (previously, this flag had no effect on OS X).
  - add support for the '-=', '*=', '/=', and'%=' operators to
    skylark.  Notably, we do not support '|=' because the semantics
    of skylark sets are sufficiently different from python sets.

Important changes:

  - Use singular form when appropriate in blaze's test result summary
    message.
  - Added supported for Android NDK revision 11
  - --objc_generate_debug_symbols is now deprecated.
  - swift_library now generates an Objective-C header for its @objc
    interfaces.
  - new_objc_provider can now set the USES_SWIFT flag.
  - objc_framework now supports dynamic frameworks.
  - Symlinks in zip files are now unzipped correctly by http_archive,
    download_and_extract, etc.
  - swift_library is now able to import framework rules such as
    objc_framework.
  - Adds "jre_deps" attribute to j2objc_library.
  - Release apple_binary rule, for creating multi-architecture
    ("fat") objc/cc binaries and libraries, targeting ios platforms.
  - Aspects documentation added.
  - The --ues_isystem_for_includes command line option is not
    supported anymore.
  - global function 'provider' is removed from .bzl files. Providers
    can only be accessed through fields in a 'target' object.

## Release 0.2.3 (2016-05-10)

```
Baseline: 5a2dd7a
```

Incompatible changes:

  - All repositories are now directly under the x.runfiles directory
    in the runfiles tree (previously, external repositories were at
    x.runfiles/main-repo/external/other-repo. This simplifies
    handling remote repository runfiles considerably, but will break
    existing references to external repository runfiles.
    Furthermore, if a Bazel project does not provide a workspace name
    in the WORKSPACE file, Bazel will now default to using __main__
    as the workspace name (instead of "", as previously). The
    repository's runfiles will appear under x.runfiles/__main__/.
  - Bazel does not embed protocol buffer-related rules anymore.
  - It is now an error for a cc rule's includes attribute to point to
    the workspace root.
  - Bazel warns if a cc rule's includes attribute points out of
    third_party.
  - Removed cc_* attributes: abi / abi_deps. Use select() instead.

New features:

  - select({"//some:condition": None }) is now possible (this "unsets"
    the attribute).

Important changes:

  - java_import now allows its 'jars' attribute to be empty.
  - adds crunch_png attribute to android_binary
  - Replace --java_langtools, --javabuilder_top, --singlejar_top,
    --genclass_top, and --ijar_top with
    java_toolchain.{javac,javabuilder,singlejar,genclass,ijar}
  - External repository correctness fix: adding a new file/directory
    as a child of a new_local_repository is now noticed.
  - iOS apps are signed with get-task-allow=1 unless building with -c
    opt.
  - Generate debug symbols (-g) is enabled for all dbg builds of
    objc_ rules.
  - Bazel's workspace name is now io_bazel. If you are using Bazel's
    source as an external repository, then you may want to update the
    name you're referring to it as or you'll begin seeing warnings
    about name mismatches in your code.
  - Fixes integer overflow in J2ObjC sources to be Java-compatible.
  - A FlagPolicy specified via the --invocation_policy flag will now
    match the current command if any of its commands matches any of
    the commands the current command inherits from, as opposed to
    just the current command.
  - The key for the map to cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains is now a
    string of the form "cpu|compiler" (previously, it was just "cpu").
  - Fix interaction between LIPO builds and C++ header modules.
  - Ctrl-C will now interrupt a download, instead of waiting for it to
    finish.
  - Proxy settings can now be specified in http_proxy and https_proxy
    environment variables (not just HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY).
  - Skylark targets can now read include directories from
    ObjcProvider.
  - Expose parameterized aspects to Skylark.
  - Support alwayslink cc_library dependencies in objc binaries.
  - Import cc_library dependencies in generated Xcode project.

```

Patch release, only includes fixes to C++ auto-configuration.

## Release 0.2.1 (2016-03-21)

```
Baseline: 19b5675
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Skylark rules that are available from their own repository will
    now issue a warning when accessed through @bazel_tools.
  - Set --legacy_bazel_java_test to off by default. java_test will
    now have a slightly different behaviour, correctly emitting XML
    file but, as a downside, it needs correct declaration of the
    test suite (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/1017).
  - Labels in .bzl files in remote repositories will be resolved
    relative to their repository (instead of the repository the
    Skylark rule is used in).
  - Renamed proto_java_library to java_proto_library.  The former
    is now deprecated and will print out a warning when used.
  - android_sdk now compiles android_jack on the fly from
    android_jar, which means android_jar must be a jar and
    android_jack is now deprecated. The Jack tools (jack, jill,
    resource_extractor) must be specified.
  - Any project that depended on the objc_options rule will be
    broken. Can be fixed by adding attrs (infoplists,copts) directly
    to rules depending on the options.
  - .aidl files correctly require import statements for types
    defined in the same package and the same android_library.

New features:

  - Experimental Windows support is available.
  - Experimental support for writing remote repository rules in
    Skylark is available.
  - iOS ipa_post_processor attribute allows for user-defined IPA
    edits.
  - Adds a to_json method to Skylark structs, providing conversion to
    JSON format.
  - Native python rule can depend on skylark rule as long as skylark
    rule provides 'py' provider.
  - When using both --verbose_failures and --sandbox_debug, Bazel
    prints instructions how to spawn a debugging shell inside the
    sandbox.
  - add flag --sandbox_add_path, which takes a list of additional
    paths as argument and mount these paths to sandbox.

Important changes:

  - @androidsdk//:org_apache_http_legacy added for the legacy Apache
    classes for android sdk version 23 and above.
  - Genrules correctly work when used with bazel run.
  - When namespace-sandbox is run with the -D (debug) flag and
    inside a terminal, it spawns a shell inside the sandbox to aid in
    debugging when the sandboxed command fails.
  - Added --artifact to workspace generator for generating workspace
    and build file rules from artifact coodrinates.
  - Specifying --experimental_android_resource_shrinking on the
    command line will enable a resource shrinking pass on
    android_binary targets that already use Proguard.
  - J2ObjC updated to 1.0.1 release.
  - Added "root_symlinks" and "symlinks" parameters to Skylark
    runfiles() method.
  - You can no longer use objc_binary targets for the xctest_app
    attribute of an ios_test rule.
  - Enable overriding jsonnet binaries and stdlib for Jsonnet rules.
  - mount target of /etc/resolv.conf if it is a symlink.
  - Tests that failed to build because execution was halted no longer
    print their status.
  - Bazel warns if a cc rule's includes attribute contains up-level
    references that escape its package.
  - Add repository_ctx.download and repository_ctx.download_and_extract
    function.

## Release 0.2.0 (2016-02-18)

```
Baseline: 9e100ac
```

Incompatible changes:

  - ObjC compile actions for J2ObjC-translated code now only has
    access to headers from the java deps of the associated original
    java rule.
    These compile actions no longer takes the compiler options
    specified in "copts" attribute on objc_binary/ios_test rules.
    J2ObjC dead code removal (enabled through flag
    "--j2objc_dead_code_removal") now happens *after* ObjC
    compilation.
  - maven_jar no longer supports separate artifact_id, group_id, and
    verison fields. This information should be provided in the
    artifact field,
    instead.

New features:

  - Better support for toolchains that don't have a dynamic linker.
  - build_file_content attribute added to new_git_repository,
    new_http_archive, and new_local_repository.
  - Add support for .tar.bz2 archives to http_archive rules.

Important changes:

  - The --skyframe flag is no longer available for the build command.
  - The --artifacts flag was removed from the dump command.
  - The sha256 attribute is now optional (although recommended!) for
    remote repository rules.
  - Add instrumented file provider support to Skylark rules.
  - Add imports attribute to native Python rules.
  - Allow overriding -gsplit-dwarf from copts.
  - Improved sandbox performance on XFS filesystems.

## Release 0.1.5 (2016-02-05)

```
Baseline: 3a95f35
   + 8378cd8: Rollback of commit
              a9b84575a32476a5faf991da22b44661d75c19b6.
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Set stamping to false by default (i.e., --nostamp)
  - Removed --objc_dump_syms_binary.
  - Removes --objc_gcov_binary flag.
  - Remove JAVAC "Make" variable
  - The startup flag --blaze_cpu is removed,

New features:

  - A new java test runner that support XML output and test filtering
    is supported. It can be used by specifying --nolegacy_bazel_java_test
    or by specifying the test_class attribute on a java_test.
  - Skylark aspects can now specify configuration fragment
    dependencies with fragments and host_fragments like rules can.

Important changes:

  - Support for downloading remote resources through proxies by
    setting HTTP_PROXY (or HTTPS_PROXY).
  - Timestamps within Android apks are removed to make apks
    deterministic.
  - Support aggregation over existing rules in Skylark extensions
    through native.rules and native.rule.
  - A tools/bazel script in the workspace will be executed
    as an opportunity to use a fixed version of Bazel (not
    implemented for the homebrew recipe yet).
  - --noimplicit_deps and --nohost_deps work correctly for Aspect
    attributes.
  - JDK-related targets are now available via @local_jdk (instead of
    @local-jdk).
  - j2objc tools can now be accessed via @bazel_j2objc, not
    @bazel-j2objc.
  - Repository rules must use names that are valid workspace names.
  - [rust] Update to Rust 1.6
  - Add support for .tar.xz archives to http_archive rules.
  - Make C++ modules compatible with tools using
    --compilation_prerequisites_only
  - [d] Update to DMD 2.070.0

## Release 0.1.4 (2016-01-15)

```
Baseline: e933d5e
   + 3d796fe: Rollback of commit
              ac6ed79e1a3fa6b0ca91657b28e2a35f7e49758c.
   + 7a02e5d: Fix installer under OS X
   + 848740c: Fix bazel version for debian package
   + 7751d43: Add a method for getting the root of a rule workspace
              to the Label method
```

Important changes:

  - add loadfiles() query operator, to find skylark files loaded by
    targets.
  - Added ability to declare and use aspects in Skylark.
  - Skylark load statements may now reference .bzl files via build
    labels, in addition to paths. In particular, such labels can be
    used to reference Skylark files in external repositories; e.g.,
    load("@my_external_repo//some_pkg:some_file.bzl", ...).
    Path-based loads are now deprecated and may be disabled in the
    future. Caveats: Skylark files currently do not respect package
    visibility; i.e., all Skylark files are effectively public. Also,
    loads may not reference the special //external package.
  - Relative paths can now be used for 'path' with
    new_local_repository and local_repository.

## Release 0.1.3 (2016-01-07)

```
Baseline: 23ad8f6
   + de2183d: Only depend on the WORKSPACE file for external files
              that are under the external/ directory, i.e. were
              created by Bazel.
   + f8f855c: Rollback of commit
              12bad3af0eade9c4b79d76f9e1c950ad2e3214c2.
   + f627562: Stop parsing the WORKSPACE file when a parse error is
              detected
   + 763f139: Add -fno-canonical-system-headers to CROSSTOOL files so
              that gcc doesn't resolve symlinks in .d files, which
              would confuse Blaze.
   + b95995b: Use openjdk7 as dependency for debian package of jdk7
              flavor
```

New features:

  - Skylark macros are now enabled in WORKSPACE file.
  - .bazelrc allows workspace-relative imports as "import
    %workspace%/path/to/rcfile"
  - Evaluate the query expression in a file by passing
    --query_file=<file> to query

Important changes:

  - Remove obsolete --objc_per_proto_includes flag.
  - iOS apps and extensions now have launch_storyboard
  - Passing multiple JVM options via a single --host_jvm_args flag is
    now deprecated. Pass each JVM option behind its own
    --host_jvm_args flag.
  - Resources defined locally on an android_library rule will respect
    the neverlink attribute.
  - Update Rust to 1.4
  - Fix resource handling for exported android_library rules
  - Files in external repositories are now treated as mutable, which
    will make the correctness guarantees of using external
    repositories stronger (existent), but may cause performance
    penalties.

## Release 0.1.2 (2015-11-20)

```
Baseline: ee0ade3
   + 1e66ccd: RELNOTES: Symlink dirents of directories containing a
              file named
              "DONT_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS_WHEN_TRAVERSING_THIS_DIRECTORY_VIA
              _A_RECURSIVE_TARGET_PATTERN" will *not* be traversed
              for transitive target patterns. The motivation here is
              to allow directories that intentionally contain wonky
              symlinks (e.g. foo/bar -> foo) to opt out of being
              consumed by Blaze. For example, given
   + f5773fc: Set the ijar MAX_BUFFER_SIZE to 256 MB
```

New features:

  - java_library now supports the proguard_specs attribute for
    passing Proguard configuration up to Android (not Java) binaries.
  - http_file can specify "executable" to make the downloaded file
    runnable.
  - Debian and tar packaging is now supported
    (see tools/build_defs/pkg/README.md).
  - cpxx_builtin_include_directory specifications allow more
    flexibility.
  - accept %crosstool_top% in cxx_builtin_include_directory
  - android_binary now supports proguard_apply_mapping to re-use a
    previously generated proguard mapping.

Important changes:

  - remove webstatusserver (--use_webstatusserver).
  - Add support for objc textual headers, which will not be compiled
    when modules are enabled.
  - actoolzip, momczip and swiftstdlibtoolzip have all been made into
    bash scripts and have been renamed to actoolwrapper, momcwrapper
    and swiftstdlibtoolwrapper respectively. The old versions will be
    deleted in a later change.
  - [rust] Add rust_bench_test and rust_doc_test rules and improve
    usability of rust_test tule.
  - Java rules now support a resource_strip_prefix attribute that
    allows the removal of path prefixes from Java resources.
  - [docker_build] incremental loading is default now.
    Specify explicitly //package:target.tar (with the .tar extension)
    to obtain the full image.
  - --ios_signing_cert_name allows specifying a cert for iOS app
    signing
  - Go rules for Bazel.
  - [jsonnet] Update to Jsonnet 0.8.1.
  - [jsonnet] Add vars and code_vars attributes to jsonnet_to_json to
    allow passing external variables to Jsonnet via --var and
    --code_var.
  - Adds --override_workspace_root blaze flag to hand-set
    workspace_root and mainGroup in xcodeproj.
  - Allow dots in package names.
  - When used as a forwarding rule (i.e., has no sources),
    android_library
    will also forward any exported_plugins in its dependencies.
  - Add support for Windows-created zip files with non-posix
    permissions.
  - [jsonnet] Add jsonnet_to_json_test rule for testing Jsonnet code.
  - C++ compile actions run in a sandbox now on systems that support
    sandboxed execution.
  - The names of the clang compilers in the Android NDK crosstool no
    longer reference gcc.
  - 420 dpi is now a valid density for andoid_binary.densities.
  - Bazel does strict validation of include files now to ensure
    correct incremental builds. If you see compilation errors when
    building C++ code, please make sure that you explicitly declare
    all header files in the srcs or hdrs attribute of your cc_*
    targets and that your cc_* targets have correct "deps" on
    cc_library's that they use.
  - [jsonnet] Fix jsonnet_to_json rule to read code_vars from
    code_vars instead of vars.
  - Tests, genrules, and Skylark actions without the
    "requires-network" tag will no longer be able to access the
    network.
  - C++ libraries no longer need includes = ["."] (or similar copts)
    to include paths relative to a remote repository's root.
  - Support exports attribute for android_library
  - Symlink dirents of directories containing a file named
    "DONT_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS_WHEN_TRAVERSING_THIS_DIRECTORY_VIA_A_RECURSI
    VE_TARGET_PATTERN" will *not* be traversed for transitive target
    patterns. The motivation here is to allow directories that
    intentionally contain wonky symlinks (e.g. foo/bar -> foo) to opt
    out of being consumed by Blaze.

## Release 0.1.1 (2015-10-05)

```
Baseline: 22616ae
   + 1ef338f: Rollback of "Propagates cc_library linkopts attribute
              to dependent objc_libraries.": breaks certain
              objc_binary build targets.
   + 5fb1073: Reintroduce an inconsistency check (albeit, in a weaker
              form) removed by a previous change that was trying to
              optimize away a filesystem call.
   + 6d00468b2eb976866cfb814d562e0d53a580a46f: Add IdlClass to the embedded default android tools
              repository and rearrange BuildJar's JarHelper so that
              it too can be embedded.
   + a5199039934a2e399a7201adc0d74e2f2d2b0ff3: Fixes Android integration tests by wiring up idlclass
              rules in integration environment.
```

Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel requires JDK 8 to run.
  - Attribute "copts" is removed from j2objc_library.

New features:

  - a cc_binary rule may list '.s' and '.asm' files in the srcs
  - Support for build with libsass.
  - labels in "linkopts" may match any label in either "deps" or
    "srcs" to be considered valid.
  - Maven servers that require username & password authentication are
    now supported (see maven_server documentation).

Important changes:

  - Support empty plist files
  - The <compatible-screens> section of the AndroidManifest.xml will
    not be overwritten if it already contains a <screen> tag for each
    of the densities specified on the android_binary rule.
  - Add Jsonnet rules to Bazel
  - Remove deprecated xcode_options flag.
  - Workspace names are now restricted to being in their base
    directory
    (that is, the names cannot contain up-level references or /./).
  - j2objc_library on Bazel now transpiles transitive proto_library
    dependencies. (Note that java_* rules in Bazel do not yet support
    protos; currently they ignore proto dependencies.)
  - new_http_archive can specify a root directory.
  - Adds support for dylibs on devices for Xcode 7.
  - [d] d_docs rules now depend on a d_binary, a d_library or
    d_source_library.
  - [docker] docker_build now set the permission to 0555 to files
    added to the layer, use `mode = "0644"` to use the legacy behavior.
  - android_binary now has a main_dex_proguard_specs attribute to
    specify which classes should be in the main dex.
  - [rust] Add rust_docs rule for generating rustdoc.
## Release 0.1.0 (2015-09-08)

```
Baseline: a0881e8
   + 87374e6: Make android_binary use a constant, hard-coded,
              checked-in debug key.
