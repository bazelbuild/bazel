// A service for publishing BuildEvents. BuildEvents are generated by Build
// Systems to record actions taken during a Build. Events occur in streams,
// are identified by a StreamId, and ordered by sequence number in a stream.
//
// A Build may contain several streams of BuildEvents, depending on the systems
// that are involved in the Build. Some BuildEvents are used to declare the
// beginning and end of major portions of a Build; these are called
// LifecycleEvents, and are used (for example) to indicate the beginning or end
// of a Build, and the beginning or end of an Invocation attempt (there can be
// more than 1 Invocation in a Build if, for example, a failure occurs somewhere
// and it needs to be retried).
//
// Other, build-tool events represent actions taken by the Build tool, such as
// target objects produced via compilation, tests run, et cetera. There could be
// more than one build tool stream for an invocation attempt of a build.
