// The Remote Asset API provides a mapping from a URI and Qualifiers to
// Digests.  
//
// Multiple URIs may be used to refer to the same content.  For example, the
// same tarball may exist at multiple mirrors and thus be retrievable from
// multiple URLs.  When URLs are used, these should refer to actual content as
// Fetch service implementations may choose to fetch the content directly
// from the origin.  For example, the HEAD of a git repository's active branch
// can be referred to as:
//
//     uri: https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis.git
//
// URNs may be used to strongly identify content, for instance by using the
// uuid namespace identifier: urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6.
// This is most applicable to named content that is Push'd, where the URN
// serves as an agreed-upon key, but carries no other inherent meaning.
//
// Service implementations may choose to support only URLs, only URNs for
// Push'd content, only other URIs for which the server and client agree upon
// semantics of, or any mixture of the above.

// Qualifiers are used to disambiguate or sub-select content that shares a URI.
// This may include specifying a particular commit or branch, in the case of
// URIs referencing a repository; they could also be used to specify a
// particular subdirectory of a repository or tarball. Qualifiers may also be
// used to ensure content matches what the client expects, even when there is
// no ambiguity to be had - for example, a qualifier specifying a checksum
// value.
//
// In cases where the semantics of the request are not immediately clear from
// the URL and/or qualifiers - e.g. dictated by URL scheme - it is recommended
// to use an additional qualifier to remove the ambiguity. The `resource_type`
// qualifier is recommended for this purpose.
//
// Qualifiers may be supplied in any order.
message Qualifier {
  // The "name" of the qualifier, for example "resource_type".

// The Fetch service resolves or fetches assets referenced by URI and

  //
  // Servers *MAY* fetch content that they do not already have cached, for any
  // URLs they support.
  //
  // Servers *SHOULD* ensure that referenced files are present in the CAS at the
  // time of the response, and (if supported) that they will remain available
  // for a reasonable period of time. The lifetimes of the referenced blobs *SHOULD*
  // be increased if necessary and applicable.
  // In the event that a client receives a reference to content that is no
  // longer present, it *MAY* re-issue the request with
  // `oldest_content_accepted` set to a more recent timestamp than the original
  // attempt, to induce a re-fetch from origin.
  //
  // Servers *MAY* cache fetched content and reuse it for subsequent requests,
  // subject to `oldest_content_accepted`.
  //
  // Servers *MAY* support the complementary [Push][build.bazel.remote.asset.v1.Push]
  // API and allow content to be directly inserted for use in future fetch
  // responses.
  //
  // Servers *MUST* ensure Fetch'd content matches all the specified
  // qualifiers except in the case of previously Push'd resources, for which
  // the server *MAY* trust the pushing client to have set the qualifiers
  // correctly, without validation.
  //
  // Servers not implementing the complementary [Push][build.bazel.remote.asset.v1.Push]
  // API *MUST* reject requests containing qualifiers it does not support.
  //
  // Servers *MAY* transform assets as part of the fetch. For example a
  // tarball fetched by [FetchDirectory][build.bazel.remote.asset.v1.Fetch.FetchDirectory]
  // might be unpacked, or a Git repository
  // fetched by [FetchBlob][build.bazel.remote.asset.v1.Fetch.FetchBlob]
  // might be passed through `git-archive`.
  //
  // Errors handling the requested assets will be returned as gRPC Status errors
  // here; errors outside the server's control will be returned inline in the
  // `status` field of the response (see comment there for details).
  // The possible RPC errors include:
  // * `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: One or more arguments were invalid, such as a
  //   qualifier that is not supported by the server.
  // * `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: There is insufficient quota of some resource to
  //   perform the requested operation. The client may retry after a delay.
  // * `UNAVAILABLE`: Due to a transient condition the operation could not be
  //   completed. The client should retry.
  // * `INTERNAL`: An internal error occurred while performing the operation.
  //   The client should retry.
  // * `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The fetch could not be completed within the given
  //   RPC deadline. The client should retry for at least as long as the value
  //   provided in `timeout` field of the request.
  //
  // In the case of unsupported qualifiers, the server *SHOULD* additionally
  // send a [BadRequest][google.rpc.BadRequest] error detail where, for each
  // unsupported qualifier, there is a `FieldViolation` with a `field` of
  // `qualifiers.name` and a `description` of `"{qualifier}" not supported`
