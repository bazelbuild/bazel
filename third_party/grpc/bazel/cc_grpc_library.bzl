    This rule expects a singleton list containing a proto_library target for its
    srcs argument, and expects a list (of arbitrary size) of cc_proto_library
    targets for its deps argument.

    It generates only grpc library classes.

    Assumes the generated classes will be used in cc_api_version = 2.

    Args:
        name (str): Name of rule.
        srcs (list): A single proto_library which contains services descriptors.
        deps (list): A list of cc_proto_library targets which
          provide the compiled code of any message that the services depend on.
        generate_mocks (bool): when True, Google Mock code for client stub is
          generated. False by default.
        extra_cc_library_kwargs (map): extra arguments to pass to the cc_library
          rule
        **kwargs: extra arguments to pass to all rules instantiated by this
          macro. Must be common to all build rules. See
