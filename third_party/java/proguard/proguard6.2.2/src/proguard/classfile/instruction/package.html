<body>
This package contains classes to represent Java bytecode instructions.
<p>
Not every instruction currently has its own class. Only groups of instructions
that refer to the constant pool get their own representations.
<p>
While the package is sufficient for the current needs of the ProGuard
application, it may very well be reorganised and extended in the future.
