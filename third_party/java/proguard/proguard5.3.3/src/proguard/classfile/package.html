<body>
This package contains classes to represent the various elements of class files.
<p>
A class file is represented by the <code>{@link proguard.classfile.Clazz
Clazz}</code> interface. This interface currently has two alternative
representations:
<ul>
<li><code>{@link ProgramClass ProgramClass}</code>:
    a complete representation that can be read, modified, and written back.
<li><code>{@link LibraryClass LibraryClass}</code>:
    an incomplete representation that can be only be read. It is however
    more compact than <code>ProgramClass</code>, and sufficient for
    analyzing class files from library jars.
</ul>
