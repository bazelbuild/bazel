ProGuard, Java class file shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier
==========================================================================

This distribution contains the following directories:

- bin          : simple wrapper scripts to run ProGuard, its GUI, and ReTrace
- lib          : the main jars, compiled and ready to use with "java -jar ...."
- docs         : the complete documentation, licenses, etc. in html format
- examples     : some example configuration files
- src          : the source code
- buildscripts : various alternative build scripts


The best place to start is docs/index.html


Example
-------

If you want to give ProGuard a spin right away, try processing the ProGuard
jar itself:

    cd examples
    java -jar ../lib/proguard.jar @proguard.pro

The resulting proguard_out.jar contains the same application, but it's a lot
smaller.

Enjoy!
