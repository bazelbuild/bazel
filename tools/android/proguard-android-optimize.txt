# Manually generated for Bazel using Android Gradle Plugin 7.1.2, the latest as of 2/26/22
# To update, configure an app per https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code
# And after building the app for release, extract the two files from
# app/build/intermediates/default_proguard_files/global/
# For reference, this file is generated by 
# https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/refs/heads/mirror-goog-studio-main/build-system/gradle-core/src/main/java/com/android/build/gradle/ProguardFiles.java

# This is a configuration file for ProGuard.
# http://proguard.sourceforge.net/index.html#manual/usage.html
#
# Starting with version 2.2 of the Android plugin for Gradle, this file is distributed together with
# the plugin and unpacked at build-time. The files in $ANDROID_HOME are no longer maintained and
# will be ignored by new version of the Android plugin for Gradle.

# Optimizations: If you don't want to optimize, use the proguard-android.txt configuration file
# instead of this one, which turns off the optimization flags.
# Adding optimization introduces certain risks, since for example not all optimizations performed by
# ProGuard works on all versions of Dalvik.  The following flags turn off various optimizations
# known to have issues, but the list may not be complete or up to date. (The "arithmetic"
# optimization can be used if you are only targeting Android 2.0 or later.)  Make sure you test
# thoroughly if you go this route.
