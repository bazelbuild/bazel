        **Attention:** if the archive you're trying to mirror is from GitHub,
        please use URLs in the form of `https://github.com/$USER/$REPO/releases/download/...` if available.
        If you are the project maintainer, you should create and upload such an release archive.
        GitHub doesn't guarantee a stable checksum of source archives in the form of `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/archive/...`, which are generated on demand.
        Check [GitHub Archive Checksum Outage](https://blog.bazel.build/2023/02/15/github-archive-checksum.html) for more details.
