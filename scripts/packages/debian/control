Description: Bazel is a tool that automates software builds and tests.
 Supported build tasks include running compilers and linkers to produce
 executable programs and libraries, and assembling deployable packages
 for Android, iOS and other target environments. Bazel is similar to
 other tools like Make, Ant, Gradle, Buck, Pants and Maven.
