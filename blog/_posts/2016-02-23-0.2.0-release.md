title: Bazel 0.2.0 Released
---

We are delighted to announce the 0.2.0 release of Bazel. This release marks
major improvements in support for external repositories, Skylark and testing, in
particular how external repositories and Skylark can work together.

## Improvements from our [roadmap](http://bazel.io/roadmap.html)

### Skylark rules can now be loaded from remote repositories

Skylark rules can now be loaded from a remote repository.  For example, to use
the Scala rules, add the following to your WORKSPACE file:

```python
git_repository(
    name = "io_bazel_rules_scala",
    remote = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_scala.git",
    tag = "0.0.1",
)
load("@io_bazel_rules_scala//scala:scala.bzl", "scala_repositories")
scala_repositories()
```

This will download all of the tools the rules need to build Scala programs.

Then load and use normally from your BUILD files:

```python
load("@io_bazel_rules_scala//scala:scala.bzl", "scala_library")
scala_library(...)
```

We will gradually move the existing rules to their own repositories, announcing
changes on the [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bazel-discuss).

### Go build and test support

There is now Go language support, see [the
documentation](http://bazel.io/docs/be/go.html) for details.

### Open sourcing tests

We also open sourced over a
[hundred](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/src/test/java/com/google/devtools)
[tests](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/src/test/shell/integration)
and laid the foundation for open sourcing more. We will continue to open source
more tests (both to increase Bazel's stability and to make contributing easier),
but this marks a dramatic increase in test coverage.

## Other major changes since 0.1.0

* The `--package_path` definition in `.bazelrc` is no longer required, nor is
  the `base_workspace/` directory.
* JUnit test runner for Java tests - Use the `--nolegacy_bazel_java_test` flag
  (soon to be the default) to get XML output for easy integration into CI
  systems and easier debugging with `--java_debug`.
* Skylark macros can now be loaded and used in the WORKSPACE file.
* Remote repository filesystem changes are tracked.
* [Debian](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/latest/) packages and a
  [Homebrew](http://braumeister.org/formula/bazel) recipe.

For changes since 0.1.5 (the minor version before 0.2.0), see the release notes
for changes.

## Future plans

Looking ahead to 0.3.0:

* Windows support is coming!  (See the [Windows
  label](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/labels/Windows) to follow the
  progress there).
* Remote caching and execution is in progress (see [Alpha Lam's
  work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvEw3uu9mUszK-ukmSWp4Dmy43KDlHAjW75Gf17bUY8/preview)).
* XCode integration and generic IDE support.
* [Ulf](https://github.com/ulfjack) has been working on [sandboxing for OS
  X](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/osx-sandbox-hardlinks), which will
  hopefully be available soon.
* More work on parallelization. We currently have experimental support (which
  can be enabled with the `--experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis` flag)
  which improves clean build time (~30% faster loading and analysis), especially
  for builds using a lot of `select()` expressions.

## Finally...

A big thank you to our community for your continued support.  Particular
shout-outs to the following contributors:

* [Brian Silverman](https://github.com/bsilver8192) - for tons of important bug
  fixes and answering lots of user questions.
* [Alpha Lam](https://github.com/hhclam) - for writing up design docs and
  implementing remote caching/execution.
* [P. Oscar Boykin](https://github.com/posco) - for putting tons of time and
  effort into the Scala rules, as well as being a tireless supporter on Twitter.

Thank you all, keep the discussion and bug reports coming!
