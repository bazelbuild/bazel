        Leveraging the insights we gathered from helping over 50 companies to navigate Bazel, we developed Aspect Workflows, our Developer Platform for Bazel Monorepos.
        Our platform is designed to enhance the developer experience with Bazel, notably accelerating build times on CI while reducing compute costs. Aspect Workflows seamlessly integrates with your existing CI and cloud infrastructure, while aligning with your current configuration. This approach empowers users to concentrate on innovating and delivering exceptional products, while we manage the underlying infrastructure and ensure CI stays fast.
        Aspect offers consulting, support, and training to help your team succeed with Bazel and we are the authors and maintainers of the canonical open-source rulesets for JavaScript and OCI images.
