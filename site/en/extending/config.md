# Configurations

<devsite-mathjax config="TeX-AMS-MML_SVG"></devsite-mathjax>

{% include "_buttons.html" %}

This page covers the benefits and basic usage of Starlark configurations,
Bazel's API for customizing how your project builds. It includes how to define
build settings and provides examples.

This makes it possible to:

*   define custom flags for your project, obsoleting the need for
     [`--define`](/docs/configurable-attributes#custom-keys)
*   write
    [transitions](/rules/lib/builtins/transition#transition) to configure deps in
    different configurations than their parents
    (such as `--compilation_mode=opt` or `--cpu=arm`)
*   bake better defaults into rules (such as automatically build `//my:android_app`
    with a specified SDK)

and more, all completely from .bzl files (no Bazel release required). See the
`bazelbuild/examples` repo for
[examples](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations){: .external}.

## User-defined build settings {:#user-defined-build-settings}

A build setting is a single piece of
[configuration](/extending/rules#configurations)
information. Think of a configuration as a key/value map. Setting `--cpu=ppc`
and `--copt="-DFoo"` produces a configuration that looks like
`{cpu: ppc, copt: "-DFoo"}`. Each entry is a build setting.

Traditional flags like `cpu` and `copt` are native settings â€”
their keys are defined and their values are set inside native bazel java code.
Bazel users can only read and write them via the command line
and other APIs maintained natively. Changing native flags, and the APIs
that expose them, requires a bazel release. User-defined build
settings are defined in `.bzl` files (and thus, don't need a bazel release to
register changes). They also can be set via the command line
(if they're designated as `flags`, see more below), but can also be
set via [user-defined transitions](#user-defined-transitions).

### Defining build settings {:#defining-build-settings}

[End to end example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/basic_build_setting){: .external}

#### The `build_setting` `rule()` parameter {:#rule-parameter}

Build settings are rules like any other rule and are differentiated using the
Starlark `rule()` function's `build_setting`
[attribute](/rules/lib/globals/bzl#rule.build_setting).

```python
# example/buildsettings/build_settings.bzl
string_flag = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    build_setting = config.string(flag = True)
)
```

The `build_setting` attribute takes a function that designates the type of the
build setting. The type is limited to a set of basic Starlark types like
`bool` and `string`. See the `config` module
[documentation](/rules/lib/toplevel/config)  for details. More complicated typing can be
done in the rule's implementation function. More on this below.

The `config` module's functions takes an optional boolean parameter, `flag`,
which is set to false by default. if `flag` is set to true, the build setting
can be set on the command line by users as well as internally by rule writers
via default values and [transitions](/rules/lib/builtins/transition#transition).
Not all settings should be settable by users. For example, if you as a rule
writer have some debug mode that you'd like to turn on inside test rules,
you don't want to give users the ability to indiscriminately turn on that
feature inside other non-test rules.

#### Using ctx.build_setting_value {:#ctx-build-setting-value}

Like all rules, build setting rules have [implementation functions](/extending/rules#implementation-function).
The basic Starlark-type value of the build settings can be accessed via the
`ctx.build_setting_value` method. This method is only available to
[`ctx`](/rules/lib/builtins/ctx) objects of build setting rules. These implementation
methods can directly forward the build settings value or do additional work on
it, like type checking or more complex struct creation. Here's how you would
implement an `enum`-typed build setting:

```python
# example/buildsettings/build_settings.bzl
TemperatureProvider = provider(fields = ['type'])

temperatures = ["HOT", "LUKEWARM", "ICED"]

def _impl(ctx):
    raw_temperature = ctx.build_setting_value
    if raw_temperature not in temperatures:
        fail(str(ctx.label) + " build setting allowed to take values {"
             + ", ".join(temperatures) + "} but was set to unallowed value "
             + raw_temperature)
    return TemperatureProvider(type = raw_temperature)

temperature = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    build_setting = config.string(flag = True)
)
```

Note: if a rule depends on a build setting, it will receive whatever providers
the build setting implementation function returns, like any other dependency.
But all other references to the value of the build setting (such as in transitions)
will see its basic Starlark-typed value, not this post implementation function
value.

#### Defining multi-set string flags {:#multi-set-string-flags}

String settings have an additional `allow_multiple` parameter which allows the
flag to be set multiple times on the command line or in bazelrcs. Their default
value is still set with a string-typed attribute:

```python
# example/buildsettings/build_settings.bzl
allow_multiple_flag = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    build_setting = config.string(flag = True, allow_multiple = True)
)
```

```python
# example/BUILD
load("//example/buildsettings:build_settings.bzl", "allow_multiple_flag")
allow_multiple_flag(
    name = "roasts",
    build_setting_default = "medium"
)
```

Each setting of the flag is treated as a single value:

```shell
$ bazel build //my/target --//example:roasts=blonde \
    --//example:roasts=medium,dark
```

The above is parsed to `{"//example:roasts": ["blonde", "medium,dark"]}` and
`ctx.build_setting_value` returns the list `["blonde", "medium,dark"]`.

#### Instantiating build settings {:#instantiating-build-settings}

Rules defined with the `build_setting` parameter have an implicit mandatory
`build_setting_default` attribute. This attribute takes on the same type as
declared by the `build_setting` param.

```python
# example/buildsettings/build_settings.bzl
FlavorProvider = provider(fields = ['type'])

def _impl(ctx):
    return FlavorProvider(type = ctx.build_setting_value)

flavor = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    build_setting = config.string(flag = True)
)
```

```python
# example/BUILD
load("//example/buildsettings:build_settings.bzl", "flavor")
flavor(
    name = "favorite_flavor",
    build_setting_default = "APPLE"
)
```

### Predefined settings {:#predefined-settings}

[End to end example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/use_skylib_build_setting){: .external}

The
[Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib){: .external}
library includes a set of predefined settings you can instantiate without having
to write custom Starlark.

For example, to define a setting that accepts a limited set of string values:

```python
# example/BUILD
load("@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl", "string_flag")
string_flag(
    name = "myflag",
    values = ["a", "b", "c"],
    build_setting_default = "a",
)
```

For a complete list, see
[Common build setting rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/rules/common_settings.bzl){: .external}.

### Using build settings {:#using-build-settings}

#### Depending on build settings {:#depending-on-build-settings}

If a target would like to read a piece of configuration information, it can
directly depend on the build setting via a regular attribute dependency.

```python
# example/rules.bzl
load("//example/buildsettings:build_settings.bzl", "FlavorProvider")
def _rule_impl(ctx):
    if ctx.attr.flavor[FlavorProvider].type == "ORANGE":
        ...

drink_rule = rule(
    implementation = _rule_impl,
    attrs = {
        "flavor": attr.label()
    }
)
```

```python
# example/BUILD
load("//example:rules.bzl", "drink_rule")
load("//example/buildsettings:build_settings.bzl", "flavor")
flavor(
    name = "favorite_flavor",
    build_setting_default = "APPLE"
)
drink_rule(
    name = "my_drink",
    flavor = ":favorite_flavor",
)
```

Languages may wish to create a canonical set of build settings which all rules
for that language depend on. Though the native concept of `fragments` no longer
exists as a hardcoded object in Starlark configuration world, one way to
translate this concept would be to use sets of common implicit attributes. For
example:

```python
# kotlin/rules.bzl
_KOTLIN_CONFIG = {
    "_compiler": attr.label(default = "//kotlin/config:compiler-flag"),
    "_mode": attr.label(default = "//kotlin/config:mode-flag"),
    ...
}

...

kotlin_library = rule(
    implementation = _rule_impl,
    attrs = dicts.add({
        "library-attr": attr.string()
    }, _KOTLIN_CONFIG)
)

kotlin_binary = rule(
    implementation = _binary_impl,
    attrs = dicts.add({
        "binary-attr": attr.label()
    }, _KOTLIN_CONFIG)

```

#### Using build settings on the command line {:#build-settings-command-line}

Similar to most native flags, you can use the command line to set build settings
[that are marked as flags](#rule-parameter). The build
setting's name is its full target path using `name=value` syntax:

```shell
$ bazel build //my/target --//example:string_flag=some-value # allowed
$ bazel build //my/target --//example:string_flag some-value # not allowed
```

Special boolean syntax is supported:

```shell
$ bazel build //my/target --//example:boolean_flag
$ bazel build //my/target --no//example:boolean_flag
```

#### Using build setting aliases {:#using-build-setting-aliases}

You can set an alias for your build setting target path to make it easier to read
on the command line. Aliases function similarly to native flags and also make use
of the double-dash option syntax.

Set an alias by adding `--flag_alias=ALIAS_NAME=TARGET_PATH`
to your `.bazelrc` . For example, to set an alias to `coffee`:

```shell
# .bazelrc
build --flag_alias=coffee=//experimental/user/starlark_configurations/basic_build_setting:coffee-temp
```

Best Practice: Setting an alias multiple times results in the most recent
one taking precedence. Use unique alias names to avoid unintended parsing results.

To make use of the alias, type it in place of the build setting target path.
With the above example of `coffee` set in the user's `.bazelrc`:

```shell
$ bazel build //my/target --coffee=ICED
```

instead of

```shell
$ bazel build //my/target --//experimental/user/starlark_configurations/basic_build_setting:coffee-temp=ICED
```
Best Practice: While it possible to set aliases on the command line, leaving them
in a `.bazelrc` reduces command line clutter.

### Label-typed build settings {:#label-typed-build-settings}

[End to end example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/label_typed_build_setting){: .external}

Unlike other build settings, label-typed settings cannot be defined using the
`build_setting` rule parameter. Instead, bazel has two built-in rules:
`label_flag` and `label_setting`. These rules forward the providers of the
actual target to which the build setting is set. `label_flag` and
`label_setting` can be read/written by transitions and `label_flag` can be set
by the user like other `build_setting` rules can. Their only difference is they
can't customely defined.

Label-typed settings will eventually replace the functionality of late-bound
defaults. Late-bound default attributes are Label-typed attributes whose
final values can be affected by configuration. In Starlark, this will replace
the [`configuration_field`](/rules/lib/globals/bzl#configuration_field)
 API.

```python
# example/rules.bzl
MyProvider = provider(fields = ["my_field"])

def _dep_impl(ctx):
    return MyProvider(my_field = "yeehaw")

dep_rule = rule(
    implementation = _dep_impl
)

def _parent_impl(ctx):
    if ctx.attr.my_field_provider[MyProvider].my_field == "cowabunga":
        ...

parent_rule = rule(
    implementation = _parent_impl,
    attrs = { "my_field_provider": attr.label() }
)

```

```python
# example/BUILD
load("//example:rules.bzl", "dep_rule", "parent_rule")

dep_rule(name = "dep")

parent_rule(name = "parent", my_field_provider = ":my_field_provider")

label_flag(
    name = "my_field_provider",
    build_setting_default = ":dep"
)
```

### Build settings and select() {:#build-settings-and-select}

[End to end example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/select_on_build_setting){: .external}

Users can configure attributes on build settings by using
 [`select()`](/reference/be/functions#select). Build setting targets can be passed to the `flag_values` attribute of
`config_setting`. The value to match to the configuration is passed as a
`String` then parsed to the type of the build setting for matching.

```python
config_setting(
    name = "my_config",
    flag_values = {
        "//example:favorite_flavor": "MANGO"
    }
)
```

## User-defined transitions {:#user-defined-transitions}

A configuration
[transition](/rules/lib/builtins/transition#transition)
maps the transformation from one configured target to another within the
build graph.

Important: Transitions have [memory and performance impact](#memory-performance-considerations).

### Defining {:#defining}

Transitions define configuration changes between rules. For example, a request
like "compile my dependency for a different CPU than its parent" is handled by a
transition.

Formally, a transition is a function from an input configuration to one or more
output configurations. Most transitions are 1:1 such as "override the input
configuration with `--cpu=ppc`". 1:2+ transitions can also exist but come
with special restrictions.

In Starlark, transitions are defined much like rules, with a defining
`transition()`
[function](/rules/lib/builtins/transition#transition)
and an implementation function.

```python
# example/transitions/transitions.bzl
def _impl(settings, attr):
    _ignore = (settings, attr)
    return {"//example:favorite_flavor" : "MINT"}

hot_chocolate_transition = transition(
    implementation = _impl,
    inputs = [],
    outputs = ["//example:favorite_flavor"]
)
```
The `transition()` function takes in an implementation function, a set of
build settings to read(`inputs`), and a set of build settings to write
(`outputs`). The implementation function has two parameters, `settings` and
`attr`. `settings` is a dictionary {`String`:`Object`} of all settings declared
in the `inputs` parameter to `transition()`.

`attr` is a dictionary of attributes and values of the rule to which the
transition is attached. When attached as an
[outgoing edge transition](#outgoing-edge-transitions), the values of these
attributes are all configured post-select() resolution. When attached as
an [incoming edge transition](#incoming-edge-transitions), `attr` does not
include any attributes that use a selector to resolve their value. If an
incoming edge transition on `--foo` reads attribute `bar` and then also
selects on `--foo` to set attribute `bar`, then there's a chance for the
incoming edge transition to read the wrong value of `bar` in the transition.

Note: Since transitions are attached to rule definitions and `select()`s are
attached to rule instantiations (such as targets), errors related to `select()`s on
read attributes will pop up when users create targets rather than when rules are
written. It may be worth taking extra care to communicate to rule users which
attributes they should be wary of selecting on or taking other precautions.

The implementation function must return a dictionary (or list of
dictionaries, in the case of
transitions with multiple output configurations)
of new build settings values to apply. The returned dictionary keyset(s) must
contain exactly the set of build settings passed to the `outputs`
parameter of the transition function. This is true even if a build setting is
not actually changed over the course of the transition - its original value must
be explicitly passed through in the returned dictionary.

### Defining 1:2+ transitions {:#defining-1-2-transitions}

[End to end example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/multi_arch_binary){: .external}

[Outgoing edge transition](#outgoing-edge-transitions) can map a single input
configuration to two or more output configurations. This is useful for defining
rules that bundle multi-architecture code.

1:2+ transitions are defined by returning a list of dictionaries in the
transition implementation function.

```python
# example/transitions/transitions.bzl
def _impl(settings, attr):
    _ignore = (settings, attr)
    return [
        {"//example:favorite_flavor" : "LATTE"},
        {"//example:favorite_flavor" : "MOCHA"},
    ]

coffee_transition = transition(
    implementation = _impl,
    inputs = [],
    outputs = ["//example:favorite_flavor"]
)
```
They can also set custom keys that the rule implementation function can use to
read individual dependencies:

```python
# example/transitions/transitions.bzl
def _impl(settings, attr):
    _ignore = (settings, attr)
    return {
        "Apple deps": {"//command_line_option:cpu": "ppc"},
        "Linux deps": {"//command_line_option:cpu": "x86"},
    }

multi_arch_transition = transition(
    implementation = _impl,
    inputs = [],
    outputs = ["//command_line_option:cpu"]
)
```

### Attaching transitions {:#attaching-transitions}

[End to end example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/attaching_transitions_to_rules){: .external}

Transitions can be attached in two places: incoming edges and outgoing edges.
Effectively this means rules can transition their own configuration (incoming
edge transition) and transition their dependencies' configurations (outgoing
edge transition).

NOTE: There is currently no way to attach Starlark transitions to native rules.
If you need to do this, contact
bazel-discuss@googlegroups.com
for help with figuring out workarounds.

### Incoming edge transitions {:#incoming-edge-transitions}

Incoming edge transitions are activated by attaching a `transition` object
(created by `transition()`) to `rule()`'s `cfg` parameter:

```python
# example/rules.bzl
load("example/transitions:transitions.bzl", "hot_chocolate_transition")
drink_rule = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    cfg = hot_chocolate_transition,
    ...
```

Incoming edge transitions must be 1:1 transitions.

### Outgoing edge transitions {:#outgoing-edge-transitions}

Outgoing edge transitions are activated by attaching a `transition` object
(created by `transition()`) to an attribute's `cfg` parameter:

```python
# example/rules.bzl
load("example/transitions:transitions.bzl", "coffee_transition")
drink_rule = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    attrs = { "dep": attr.label(cfg = coffee_transition)}
    ...
```
Outgoing edge transitions can be 1:1 or 1:2+.

See [Accessing attributes with transitions](#accessing-attributes-with-transitions)
for how to read these keys.

### Transitions on native options {:#transitions-native-options}

[End to end example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/transition_on_native_flag){: .external}

Starlark transitions can also declare reads and writes on native build
configuration options via a special prefix to the option name.

```python
# example/transitions/transitions.bzl
def _impl(settings, attr):
    _ignore = (settings, attr)
    return {"//command_line_option:cpu": "k8"}

cpu_transition = transition(
    implementation = _impl,
    inputs = [],
    outputs = ["//command_line_option:cpu"]
```

#### Unsupported native options {:#unsupported-native-options}

Bazel doesn't support transitioning on `--define` with
`"//command_line_option:define"`. Instead, use a custom
[build setting](#user-defined-build-settings). In general, new usages of
`--define` are discouraged in favor of build settings.

Bazel doesn't support transitioning on `--config`. This is because `--config` is
an "expansion" flag that expands to other flags.

Crucially, `--config` may include flags that don't affect build configuration,
such as
[`--spawn_strategy`](/docs/user-manual#spawn-strategy)
. Bazel, by design, can't bind such flags to individual targets. This means
there's no coherent way to apply them in transitions.

As a workaround, you can explicitly itemize the flags that *are* part of
the configuration in your transition. This requires maintaining the `--config`'s
expansion in two places, which is a known UI blemish.

### Transitions on allow multiple build settings {:#transitions-multiple-build-settings}

When setting build settings that
[allow multiple values](#defining-multi-set-string-flags), the value of the
setting must be set with a list.

```python
# example/buildsettings/build_settings.bzl
string_flag = rule(
    implementation = _impl,
    build_setting = config.string(flag = True, allow_multiple = True)
)
```

```python
# example/BUILD
load("//example/buildsettings:build_settings.bzl", "string_flag")
string_flag(name = "roasts", build_setting_default = "medium")
```

```python
# example/transitions/rules.bzl
def _transition_impl(settings, attr):
    # Using a value of just "dark" here will throw an error
    return {"//example:roasts" : ["dark"]},

coffee_transition = transition(
    implementation = _transition_impl,
    inputs = [],
    outputs = ["//example:roasts"]
)
```

### No-op transitions {:#no-op-transitions}

If a transition returns `{}`, `[]`, or `None`, this is shorthand for keeping all
settings at their original values. This can be more convenient than explicitly
setting each output to itself.

```python
# example/transitions/transitions.bzl
def _impl(settings, attr):
    _ignore = (attr)
    if settings["//example:already_chosen"] is True:
      return {}
    return {
      "//example:favorite_flavor": "dark chocolate",
      "//example:include_marshmallows": "yes",
      "//example:desired_temperature": "38C",
    }

hot_chocolate_transition = transition(
    implementation = _impl,
    inputs = ["//example:already_chosen"],
    outputs = [
        "//example:favorite_flavor",
        "//example:include_marshmallows",
        "//example:desired_temperature",
    ]
)
```

### Accessing attributes with transitions {:#accessing-attributes-with-transitions}

[End to end example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/HEAD/configurations/read_attr_in_transition){: .external}

When [attaching a transition to an outgoing edge](#outgoing-edge-transitions)
(regardless of whether the transition is a 1:1 or 1:2+ transition), `ctx.attr` is forced to be a list
if it isn't already. The order of elements in this list is unspecified.


```python
# example/transitions/rules.bzl
def _transition_impl(settings, attr):
    return {"//example:favorite_flavor" : "LATTE"},

coffee_transition = transition(
    implementation = _transition_impl,
    inputs = [],
    outputs = ["//example:favorite_flavor"]
)

def _rule_impl(ctx):
    # Note: List access even though "dep" is not declared as list
    transitioned_dep = ctx.attr.dep[0]

    # Note: Access doesn't change, other_deps was already a list
    for other_dep in ctx.attr.other_deps:
      # ...


coffee_rule = rule(
    implementation = _rule_impl,
    attrs = {
        "dep": attr.label(cfg = coffee_transition)
        "other_deps": attr.label_list(cfg = coffee_transition)
    })
```

If the transition is `1:2+` and sets custom keys, `ctx.split_attr` can be used
to read individual deps for each key:

```python
# example/transitions/rules.bzl
def _impl(settings, attr):
    _ignore = (settings, attr)
    return {
        "Apple deps": {"//command_line_option:cpu": "ppc"},
        "Linux deps": {"//command_line_option:cpu": "x86"},
    }

multi_arch_transition = transition(
    implementation = _impl,
    inputs = [],
    outputs = ["//command_line_option:cpu"]
)

def _rule_impl(ctx):
    apple_dep = ctx.split_attr.dep["Apple deps"]
    linux_dep = ctx.split_attr.dep["Linux deps"]
    # ctx.attr has a list of all deps for all keys. Order is not guaranteed.
    all_deps = ctx.attr.dep

multi_arch_rule = rule(
    implementation = _rule_impl,
    attrs = {
        "dep": attr.label(cfg = multi_arch_transition)
    })
```

See [complete example](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/tree/main/configurations/multi_arch_binary)
here.

## Integration with platforms and toolchains {:#integration-platforms-toolchains}

Many native flags today, like `--cpu` and `--crosstool_top` are related to
toolchain resolution. In the future, explicit transitions on these types of
flags will likely be replaced by transitioning on the
[target platform](/extending/platforms).

## Memory and performance considerations {:#memory-performance-considerations}

Adding transitions, and therefore new configurations, to your build comes at a
cost: larger build graphs, less comprehensible build graphs, and slower
builds. It's worth considering these costs when considering
using transitions in your build rules. Below is an example of how a transition
might create exponential growth of your build graph.

### Badly behaved builds: a case study {:#badly-behaved-builds}

![Scalability graph](/rules/scalability-graph.png "Scalability graph")

**Figure 1.** Scalability graph showing a top level target and its dependencies.

This graph shows a top level target, `//pkg:app`, which depends on two targets, a
`//pkg:1_0` and `//pkg:1_1`. Both these targets depend on two targets, `//pkg:2_0` and
`//pkg:2_1`. Both these targets depend on two targets, `//pkg:3_0` and `//pkg:3_1`.
This continues on until `//pkg:n_0` and `//pkg:n_1`, which both depend on a single
target, `//pkg:dep`.

Building `//pkg:app` requires \\(2n+2\\) targets:

* `//pkg:app`
* `//pkg:dep`
* `//pkg:i_0` and `//pkg:i_1` for \\(i\\) in \\([1..n]\\)

Imagine you [implement](#user-defined-build-settings) a flag
`--//foo:owner=<STRING>` and `//pkg:i_b` applies

    depConfig = myConfig + depConfig.owner="$(myConfig.owner)$(b)"

In other words, `//pkg:i_b` appends `b` to the old value of `--owner` for all
its deps.

This produces the following [configured targets](/reference/glossary#configured-target):

```
//pkg:app                              //foo:owner=""
//pkg:1_0                              //foo:owner=""

`//pkg:dep` produces \\(2^n\\) configured targets: `config.owner=`
"\\(b_0b_1...b_n\\)" for all \\(b_i\\) in \\(\{0,1\}\\).

This makes the build graph exponentially larger than the target graph, with
corresponding memory and performance consequences.

TODO: Add strategies for measurement and mitigation of these issues.
