title: A Google Summer of Code with Bazel
---

I'm happy to announce that Bazel has been accepted as
[a mentor organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6293241017139200/)
for the
[Google Summer of Code 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/).
If you are a student and interested in working on Bazel this summer, please read
on.

Take a look at our
[ideas page](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/wiki/Project-Ideas): it is
not exhaustive and we may extend it over time, but it should give you a rough
idea of what you could work on. Feel free to come up with your new ideas or
suggest variations on our proposals. Not all projects on the page will be taken:
we expect to accept up to three students. Students will not work with a single
mentor, you can expect to interact with multiple people from the Bazel team
(although there will be a main contact point). This will ensure you'll get
timely responses and assistance, even if one of us goes on vacation.

This is the first time we participate in Google Summer of Code, please bear with
us if you miss some information. We will update our ideas page to answer the
most frequent questions.

If you have any question, please contact us on bazel-core@googlegroups.com

I'm looking forward to hearing from you,

_Laurent Le Brun, on behalf of the Bazel mentors._
