        <p class="lead">Build software of any size, quickly and reliably, just as engineers do at Google.</p>
        <p>Bazel is Google's own build tool, now publicly available in <a href="#beta">Beta</a>.
           Bazel has built-in support for building both client and server software, including client
           applications for both Android and iOS platforms. It also provides an extensible framework
           that you can use to develop your own build rules.

        <h1>Why Bazel?</h1>
        <p class="lead">Here's what makes Bazel great.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p>With Bazel's optimized dependency analysis, advanced
           caching and parallel execution of build actions, you get
           fast, clean builds.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p>At Google, Bazel is used by tens of
           thousands of engineers to build heavy-duty, mission-critical
           infrastructure services as well as public web applications. But it's
           great for smaller projects, too.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Flexibility</h3>
        <p>A comprehensive, built-in set of rules lets you build software for
           a wide variety of languages and platforms right out of the box.
           Skylark, Bazel's extensible rule framework, allows you to develop
           and share your own build rules for other languages and platforms.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Correctness</h3>
        <p>Bazel examines the content of source files in your
           dependency graph, not just timestamps, to determine when to rebuild.
           Because incremental builds are virtually always correct, it's not
           necessary to run a clean build "just in case" to ensure correctness.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Reliability</h3>
        <p>When you build software with Bazel, you're running the same code
           that has been refined and tested over years of use in the
           engineering environment at Google.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Repeatability</h3>
        <p>Builds only use input files that are explicitly declared in the
           build specification. On Linux, Bazel runs tools in a sandboxed
           environment that contain only the minimum necessary files required.
           Even tests are run in sandboxes, which ensures predictable,
           environment-independent results.

        <h1 id="beta">Bazel is in Beta</h1>
        <p>Bazel is in Beta. There are still some functional limitations,
           but we believe that Bazel is stable enough for production use.
           See our <a href="support.html">Support</a> page for information
           about feature status and releases. The Bazel team monitors and
           responds actively to bug reports from users.
