// The FailureDetail message type is designed such that consumers can extract a
// basic classification of a FailureDetail message even if the consumer was
// built with a stale definition. This forward compatibility is implemented via
// conventions on FailureDetail and its submessage types, as follows.
//
// *** FailureDetail field numbers
//
// Field numbers 1 through 100 (inclusive) are reserved for generally applicable
// values. Any number of these fields may be set on a FailureDetail message.
//
// Field numbers 101 through 10,000 (inclusive) are reserved for use inside the
// "oneof" structure. Only one of these values should be set on a FailureDetail
// message.
//
// Additional fields numbers are unlikely to be needed, but, for extreme future-
// proofing purposes, field numbers 10,001 through 1,000,000 (inclusive;
// excluding protobuf's reserved range 19000 through 19999) are reserved for
// additional generally applicable values.
//
// *** FailureDetail's "oneof" submessages
//
// Each field in the "oneof" structure is a submessage corresponding to a
// category of failure.
//
// In each of these submessage types, field number 1 is an enum whose values
// correspond to a subcategory of the failure. Generally, the enum's constant
// which maps to 0 should be interpreted as "unspecified", though this is not
// required.
//
// *** Recommended forward compatibility strategy
//
// The recommended forward compatibility strategy is to reduce a FailureDetail
// message to a pair of integers.
//
// The first integer corresponds to the field number of the submessage set
// inside FailureDetail's "oneof", which corresponds with the failure's
// category.
//
// The second integer corresponds to the value of the enum at field number 1
// within that submessage, which corresponds with the failure's subcategory.
//
// WARNING: This functionality is experimental and should not be relied on at
// this time.
// TODO(mschaller): remove experimental warning
message FailureDetail {
  // A short human-readable message describing the failure, for debugging.
  //
  // This value is *not* intended to be used algorithmically.

  // Reserved for future generally applicable values. Any of these may be set.
