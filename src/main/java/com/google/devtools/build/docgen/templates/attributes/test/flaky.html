  default is <code>False</code></p>

<p>
Marks test as flaky.
</p>

<p>
If set, executes the test up to three times, marking it as failed only if it
fails each time. By default, this attribute is set to False and the test is
executed only once. Note, that use of this attribute is generally discouraged -
tests should pass reliably when their assertions are upheld.
