<p>How "heavy" the test is.</p>

<p>A classification of the test's "heaviness": how much time/resources
it needs to run.</p>

<p>Unittests are considered "small", integration tests "medium", and end-to-end tests "large" or
"enormous". Bazel uses the size to determine a default timeout (which can be overridden using the
<code>timeout</code> attribute) and the amount of resources that have to be acquired for the test to
run. Test sizes correspond to the following resources and default timeouts:</p>
