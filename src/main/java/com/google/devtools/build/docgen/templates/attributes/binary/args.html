Command line arguments that bazel will pass to the target when it is executed
either by the <code>run</code> command or as a test. These arguments are
passed before the ones that are specified on the <code>bazel run</code> or
<code>bazel test</code> command line.
</p>

<p>
<em class="harmful">NOTE: The arguments are not passed when you run the target
outside of bazel (for example, by manually executing the binary in
<code>bazel-bin/</code>).</em>

<p>
Most binary rules permit an <code>args</code> attribute, but where
this attribute is not allowed, this fact is documented under the
specific rule.
