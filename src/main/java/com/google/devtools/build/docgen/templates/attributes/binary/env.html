<p>Dictionary of strings; values are subject to
<a href="${link make-variables#predefined_label_variables}">$(location)</a> and
<a href="${link make-variables}">"Make variable"</a> substitution; default is <code>{}</code></p>

<p>Specifies additional environment variables to set when the target is
  executed by <code>bazel run</code>.
</p>

<p>
  This attribute only applies to native rules, like <code>cc_binary</code>, <code>py_binary</code>,
  and <code>sh_binary</code>.  It does not apply to Starlark-defined executable rules. For your own
  Starlark rules, you can add an "env" attribute and use it to populate a

    <a href="/rules/lib/providers/RunEnvironmentInfo.html">RunEnvironmentInfo</a>

  Provider.
</p>

<p>
<em class="harmful">NOTE: The environment variables are not set when you run the target
outside of Bazel (for example, by manually executing the binary in
<code>bazel-bin/</code>).</em>
