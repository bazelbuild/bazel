   * Processes source files and a list of includes extracted from command line flags. Adds all found
   * files to the provided set {@code includes}.
   *
   * <p>The resulting set will include {@code mainSource} and {@code sources}. This has no real
   * impact in the case that we are scanning a single source file, since it is already known to be
   * an input. However, this is necessary when we have more than one source to scan from, for
   * example when building C++ modules. In that case we have one of two possibilities:
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>We compile a header module - there, the .cppmap file is the main source file (which we do
   *       not include-scan, as that would require an extra parser), and thus already in the input;
   *       all headers in the .cppmap file are our entry points for include scanning, but are not
   *       yet in the inputs - they get added here.
   *   <li>We compile an object file that uses a header module; currently using a header module
   *       requires all headers it can reference to be available for the compilation. The header
   *       module can reference headers that are not in the transitive include closure of the
   *       current translation unit. Therefore, {@link CppCompileAction} adds all headers specified
   *       transitively for compiled header modules as include scanning entry points, and we need to
   *       add the entry points to the inputs here.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p>{@code mainSource} is the source file relative to which the {@code cmdlineIncludes} are
   * interpreted.
   *
   * <p>Additional dependencies may be requested via {@link
   * ActionExecutionContext#getEnvironmentForDiscoveringInputs}. If any dependency is not
   * immediately available, processing will be short-circuited. The caller should check {@link
   * com.google.devtools.build.skyframe.SkyFunction.Environment#valuesMissing} - if it returns
   * {@code true}, then include scanning did not complete and a skyframe restart is necessary.
   *
   * @throws NoSuchPackageException if hint collection fails due to package problems
