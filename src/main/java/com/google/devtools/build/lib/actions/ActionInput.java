/**
 * Represents an input file to a build action, with an appropriate relative path.
 *
 * <p>Artifact is the only notable implementer of the interface, but the interface remains
 * because 1) some Google specific rules ship files that could be Artifacts to remote execution
 * by instantiating ad-hoc derived classes of ActionInput.  2) historically, Google C++ rules
 * allow underspecified C++ builds. For that case, we have extra logic to guess the undeclared
 * header inclusions (eg. computed inclusions). The extra logic lives in a file that is not
 * needed for remote execution, but is a dependency, and it is inserted as a non-Artifact
 * ActionInput.
 *
 * <p>ActionInput is used as a cache "key" for ActionInputFileCache: for Artifacts, the
 * digest/size is already stored in Artifact, but for non-artifacts, we use getExecPathString
 * to find this data in a filesystem related cache.
