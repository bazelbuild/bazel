/**
 * A Builder consumes top-level artifacts, targets, and tests,, and executes them in some
 * topological order, possibly concurrently, using some dependency-checking policy.
 *
 * <p> The methods of the Builder interface are typically long-running, but honor the
 * {@link java.lang.Thread#interrupt} contract: if an interrupt is delivered to the thread in which
 * a call to buildTargets or buildArtifacts is active, the Builder attempts to terminate the call
 * prematurely, throwing InterruptedException.  No guarantee is made about the timeliness of such
 * termination, as it depends on the ability of the Actions being executed to be interrupted, but
 * typically any running subprocesses will be quickly killed.

   * @param targetsToBuild Set of targets which will be built
   * @param targetsToSkip Set of targets which should be skipped (they still show up in build
   *     results, but with a "SKIPPED" status and without the cost of any actual build work)
   * @param aspects Set of aspects that will be built
   * @param executor an opaque application-specific value that will be passed down to the execute()
   *     method of any Action executed during this call
   * @param builtTargets (out) set of successfully built subset of targetsToBuild. This set is
   *     populated immediately upon confirmation that artifact is built so it will be valid even if
   *     a future action throws ActionExecutionException
   * @param builtAspects (out) set of successfully built subset of targetsToBuild with the passed
   *     aspects applied. This set is populated immediately upon confirmation that artifact is built
   *     so it will be valid even if a future action throws ActionExecutionException
   * @param lastExecutionTimeRange If not null, the start/finish time of the last build that run the
   *     execution phase.
   * @param topLevelArtifactContext contains the options which determine the artifacts to build for
   *     the top-level targets.
   * @throws BuildFailedException if there were problems establishing the action execution
   *     environment, if the metadata of any file during the build could not be obtained, if any
   *     input files are missing, or if an action fails during execution
   * @throws InterruptedException if there was an asynchronous stop request
   * @throws TestExecException if any test fails
