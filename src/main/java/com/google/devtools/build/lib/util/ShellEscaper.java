 * Utility class to escape strings for use with shell commands.
 *
 * <p>Escaped strings may safely be inserted into shell commands. Escaping is
 * only done if necessary. Strings containing only shell-neutral characters
 * will not be escaped.
 *
 * <p>This is a replacement for {@code ShellUtils.shellEscape(String)} and
 * {@code ShellUtils.prettyPrintArgv(java.util.List)} (see
 * {@link com.google.devtools.build.lib.shell.ShellUtils}). Its advantage is the use
 * of standard building blocks from the {@code com.google.common.base}
 * package, such as {@link Joiner} and {@link CharMatcher}, making this class
 * more efficient and reliable than {@code ShellUtils}.
 *
 * <p>The behavior is slightly different though: this implementation will
 * defensively escape non-ASCII letters and digits, whereas
 * {@code shellEscape} does not.

   * Escapes a string by adding strong (single) quotes around it if necessary.
   *
   * <p>A string is not escaped iff it only contains safe characters.
   * The following characters are safe:
   * <ul>
   * <li>ASCII letters and digits: [a-zA-Z0-9]
   * <li>shell-neutral characters: at symbol (@), percent symbol (%),
   *     dash/minus sign (-), underscore (_), plus sign (+), colon (:),
   *     comma(,), period (.) and slash (/).
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>A string is escaped iff it contains at least one non-safe character.
   * Escaped strings are created by replacing every occurrence of single
   * quotes with the string '\'' and enclosing the result in a pair of
   * single quotes.
   *
   * <p>Examples:
   * <ul>
   * <li>"{@code foo}" becomes "{@code foo}" (remains the same)
   * <li>"{@code +bar}" becomes "{@code +bar}" (remains the same)
   * <li>"" becomes "{@code''}" (empty string becomes a pair of strong quotes)
   * <li>"{@code $BAZ}" becomes "{@code '$BAZ'}"
   * <li>"{@code quote'd}" becomes "{@code 'quote'\''d'}"
