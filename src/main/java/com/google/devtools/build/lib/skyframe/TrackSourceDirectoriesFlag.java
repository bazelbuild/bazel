/**
 * A flag to enable / disable tracking of source directories. Uses a system property which can be
 * set via a startup flag. The intention is for this code to be temporary, so I didn't want to add a
 * permanent flag to startup options (and there's already --host_jvm_args, which we can use to roll
 * this out). The flag affects Skyframe dependencies, so it needs to clear the Skyframe graph - the
 * easiest way to do that is to restart the server, which is done when --host_jvm_args changes.
