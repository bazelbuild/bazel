/**
 * An executable command, including its arguments and runtime environment (environment variables,
 * working directory). It lets a caller execute a command, get its results, and optionally forward
 * interrupts to the subprocess. This class creates threads to ensure timely reading of subprocess
 * outputs.
 *
 * <p>This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 *
 * <p>The use of "shell" in the package name of this class is a misnomer. In terms of the way its
 * arguments are interpreted, this class is closer to {@code execve(2)} than to {@code system(3)}.
 * No shell is executed.
 *
 * <h4>Examples</h4>
 *
 * <p>The most basic use-case for this class is as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   String[] args = { "/bin/du", "-s", directory };
 *   BlazeCommandResult result = new Command(args).execute();
 *   String output = new String(result.getStdout());
 * </pre>
 *
 * which writes the output of the {@code du(1)} command into {@code output}. More complex cases
 * might inspect the stderr stream, kill the subprocess asynchronously, feed input to its standard
 * input, handle the exceptions thrown if the command fails, or print the termination status (exit
 * code or signal name).
 *
 * <h4>Other Features</h4>
 *
 * <p>A caller can optionally specify bytes to be written to the process's "stdin". The returned
 * {@link CommandResult} object gives the caller access to the exit status, as well as output from
 * "stdout" and "stderr". To use this class with processes that generate very large amounts of
 * input/output, consider {@link #execute(OutputStream, OutputStream)}, {@link
 * #executeAsync(OutputStream, OutputStream)}, or {@link #executeAsync(InputStream, OutputStream,
 * OutputStream, boolean)}.
 *
 * <p>This class ensures that stdout and stderr streams are read promptly, avoiding potential
 * deadlock if the output is large. See <a
 * href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1229-traps.html">when <code>Runtime.exec()
 * </code> won't</a>.
 *
 * <h4>Caution: Invoking Shell Commands</h4>
 *
 * <p>Perhaps the most common command invoked programmatically is the UNIX shell, {@code /bin/sh}.
 * Because the shell is a general-purpose programming language, care must be taken to ensure that
 * variable parts of the shell command (e.g. strings entered by the user) do not contain shell
 * metacharacters, as this poses a correctness and/or security risk.
 *
 * <p>To execute a shell command directly, use the following pattern:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   String[] args = { "/bin/sh", "-c", shellCommand };
 *   BlazeCommandResult result = new Command(args).execute();
 * </pre>
 *
 * {@code shellCommand} is a complete Bourne shell program, possibly containing all kinds of
 * unescaped metacharacters. For example, here's a shell command that enumerates the working
 * directories of all processes named "foo":
 *
 * <pre>ps auxx | grep foo | awk '{print $1}' |
 *      while read pid; do readlink /proc/$pid/cwd; done</pre>
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that this string means what they intend.
 *
 * <p>Consider the risk posed by allowing the "foo" part of the previous command to be some
 * arbitrary (untrusted) string called {@code processName}:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  // WARNING: unsafe!
 *  String shellCommand = "ps auxx | grep " + processName + " | awk '{print $1}' | "
 *  + "while read pid; do readlink /proc/$pid/cwd; done";</pre>
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * Passing this string to {@link Command} is unsafe because if the string {@code processName}
 * contains shell metacharacters, the meaning of the command can be arbitrarily changed; consider:
 *
 * <pre>String processName = ". ; rm -fr $HOME & ";</pre>
 *
 * <p>To defend against this possibility, it is essential to properly quote the variable portions of
 * the shell command so that shell metacharacters are escaped. Use {@link ShellUtils#shellEscape}
 * for this purpose:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  // Safe.
 *  String shellCommand = "ps auxx | grep " + ShellUtils.shellEscape(processName)
 *      + " | awk '{print $1}' | while read pid; do readlink /proc/$pid/cwd; done";
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Tip: if you are only invoking a single known command, and no shell features (e.g. $PATH
 * lookup, output redirection, pipelines, etc) are needed, call it directly without using a shell,
 * as in the {@code du(1)} example above.
