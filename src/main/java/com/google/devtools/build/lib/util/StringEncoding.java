/**
 * Utility functions for reencoding strings between Bazel's internal raw byte encoding and regular
 * Java strings.
 *
 * <p>Bazel needs to support the following two setups:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Standard setup: file paths, command-line arguments, environment variables, BUILD and .bzl
 *       files are all encoded in UTF-8, on Linux, macOS or Windows.
 *   <li>Legacy setup: file paths, command-line arguments, environment variables, BUILD and .bzl
 *       files are all encoded in <i>some</i> consistent superset of ASCII, on Linux, with the
 *       en_US.ISO-8859-1 locale available on the host. In particular, this setup allows any byte
 *       sequence to appear in a file path and be referenced in a BUILD file.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Bazel achieves this by forcing an en_US.ISO-8859-1 locale on Unix when available, which due to
 * the byte-based nature of Unix APIs allows all Java (N)IO functions to treat strings as raw byte
 * sequences (a Latin-1 character is equivalent to an unconstrained byte value). On macOS, where the
 * JVM forces UTF-8 encoding for any kind of system interaction, as well as on Windows, where system
 * APIs are all restricted to valid Unicode strings, Bazel has to reencode strings to Unicode before
 * passing them to the JVM (and vice versa). Since BUILD and .bzl files are always read into Latin-1
 * strings (file encodings are not forced by the JVM) and are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8 (unless
 * the Latin-1 locale is available), Bazel has to reencode the strings to UTF-8 so that they match
 * up with the Starlark contents of these files (e.g. file paths mentioned in a BUILD file).
 *
 * <p>While allowing the user a great deal of flexibility, this requires great care when {@link
 * String}s are passed into or out of Bazel via Java standard library functions or external APIs.
 * The following three different types of strings need to be distinguished as if they were different
 * Java types:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Internal strings: All strings retained by Bazel and used in its inner layers are expected
 *       to be raw byte sequences stored in Latin-1 {@link String}s. With Java's compact string
 *       representation, this means that the Latin-1 bytes are stored directly in the internal byte
 *       array {@link String#value} and the {@link String#coder} is {@link String#LATIN1}.
 *   <li>Unicode strings: Regular Java strings, which are always Unicode. A common example is a
 *       {@code string} field in a protobuf message.
 *   <li>Platform strings: Strings that are passed to or returned from Java (N)IO functions or as
 *       command-line arguments or environment variables to the {@code java} binary at startup or
 *       processes started via {@link java.lang.ProcessBuilder}. These strings are encoded and
 *       decoded by the JVM according to its default native encoding, which is given by the {@code
 *       sun.jnu.encoding} system property. With the current JDK version (21), this is:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>UTF-8 on macOS;
 *         <li>determined by the active code page on Windows (Cp1252 on US Windows, can be set to
 *             UTF-8 by the user);
 *         <li>determined by the current locale on Linux (forced to en_US.ISO-8859-1 by the client
 *             if available, otherwise usually UTF-8);
 *         <li>determined by the current locale on OpenBSD, which is always UTF-8.
 *       </ul>
 *       As a result, there are two cases to consider:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>On Linux with a Latin-1 locale, platform strings are identical to internal strings
 *             and Java (N)IO functions can be used to operate with Unix API on a raw byte level.
 *         <li>In all other cases, platform strings are a subset of Unicode strings.
 *       </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The static methods in this class efficiently reencode {@link String}s between these three
 * "types". Crucially, since ASCII strings are encoded identically in ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8, such
 * strings do not need to be reencoded.
