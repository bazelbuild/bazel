/**
 * A runner for spawns. Implementations can execute spawns on the local machine as a subprocess with
 * or without sandboxing, on a remote machine, or only consult a remote cache.
 *
 * <h2>Environment Variables</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementations MUST set the specified environment variables.
 *   <li>Implementations MAY add TMPDIR as an additional env variable, if it is not set already.
 *   <li>If an implementation sets TMPDIR, it MUST be set to an absolute path.
 *   <li>Implementations MUST NOT add any other environment variables.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Command line</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementations MUST use the specified command line unmodified by default.
 *   <li>Implementations MAY modify the specified command line if explicitly requested by the user.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Process</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementations MUST be thread-safe.
 *   <li>Implementations MUST ensure that all child processes (including transitive) exit in all
 *       cases, including successful completion, interruption, and timeout
 *   <li>Implementations MUST return the exit code as observed from the subprocess if the subprocess
 *       exits naturally; they MUST not throw an exception for non-zero exit codes
 *   <li>Implementations MUST be interruptible; they MUST throw {@link InterruptedException} from
 *       {@link #exec} when interrupted
 *   <li>Implementations MUST apply the specified timeout to the execution of the subprocess
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>If no timeout is specified, the implementation MAY apply an implementation-specific
 *             timeout
 *         <li>If the specified timeout is larger than an implementation-dependent maximum, then the
 *             implementation MUST throw {@link IllegalArgumentException}; it MUST not silently
 *             change the timeout to a smaller value
 *         <li>If the timeout is exceeded, the implementation MUST throw TimeoutException, with the
 *             timeout that was applied to the subprocess (TODO)
 *       </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Optimistic Concurrency</h2>
 *
 * Bazel may choose to execute a spawn using multiple {@link SpawnRunner} implementations
 * simultaneously in order to minimize total latency. This is especially useful for builds with few
 * actions where remotely executing the actions incurs high round trip times.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>All implementations MUST call {@link SpawnExecutionContext#lockOutputFiles} before writing
 *       to any of the output files, but may write to stdout and stderr without calling it. Instead,
 *       all callers must provide temporary locations for stdout & stderr if they ever call multiple
 *       {@link SpawnRunner} implementations concurrently. Spawn runners that use the local machine
 *       MUST either call it before starting the subprocess, or ensure that subprocesses write to
 *       temporary locations (for example by running in a mount namespace) and then copy or move the
 *       outputs into place.
 *   <li>Implementations SHOULD delay calling {@link SpawnExecutionContext#lockOutputFiles} until
 *       just before writing.
 * </ul>
