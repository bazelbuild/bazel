/**
 * A Builder consumes an Action graph, and executes it in some topological
 * order, possibly concurrently, using some dependency-checking policy.
 *
 * <p> The methods of the Builder interface are typically long-running, but
 * honour the {@link java.lang.Thread#interrupt} contract: if an interrupt is
 * delivered to the thread in which a call to buildTargets or buildArtifacts is
 * active, the Builder attempts to terminate the call prematurely, throwing
 * InterruptedException.  No guarantee is made about the timeliness of such
 * termination, as it depends on the ability of the Actions being executed to
