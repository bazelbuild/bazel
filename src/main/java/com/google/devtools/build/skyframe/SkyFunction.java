     * Requests {@code depKeys} "in parallel", independent of each others' results. These keys may

     *
     * <p>In general, if the result of one getValue call can affect the argument of a later getValue
     * call, the two calls cannot be merged into a single getValuesAndExceptions call, since the
     * result of the first call might change on a later evaluation. Inversely, if the result of one
     * getValue call cannot affect the parameters of the next getValue call, the two keys can form a
     * dependency group and the two getValue calls should be merged into one getValuesAndExceptions
     * call. In the latter case, if we fail to combine the _multiple_ getValue (or
     * getValuesAndExceptions) calls into one _single_ getValuesAndExceptions call, it would result
     * in multiple dependency groups with an implicit ordering between them. This would
     * unnecessarily cause sequential evaluations of these groups and could impact overall
     * performance.
     *
     * <p>On subsequent evaluations, when checking to see if dependencies require re-evaluation, all
     * the values within one group may be simultaneously checked. A SkyFunction should request a
     * dependency group if checking the deps serially on a subsequent evaluation would take too
     * long, and if the {@link #compute} method would request all deps anyway as long as no earlier
     * deps had changed. SkyFunction.Environment implementations may also choose to request these
     * deps in parallel on the first evaluation, potentially speeding it up.
     *
     * <p>While re-evaluating every value in the group may take longer than re-evaluating just the
     * first one and finding that it has changed, no extra work is done: the contract of the
     * dependency group means that the {@link #compute} method, when called to re-evaluate this
     * value, will request all values in the group again anyway, so they would have to have been
     * built in any case.
     *
     * <p>Example of when to use getValuesAndExceptions: A ListProcessor value is built with key
     * inputListRef. The {@link #compute} method first calls getValue(InputList.key(inputListRef)),
     * and retrieves inputList. It then iterates through inputList, calling getValue on each input.
     * Finally, it processes the whole list and returns. Say inputList is (a, b, c). Since the
     * {@link #compute} method will unconditionally call getValue(a), getValue(b), and getValue(c),
     * the {@link #compute} method can instead just call getValuesAndExceptions({a, b, c}). If the
     * value is later dirtied the evaluator will evaluate a, b, and c in parallel (assuming the
     * inputList value was unchanged), and re-evaluate the ListProcessor value only if at least one
     * of them was changed. On the other hand, if the InputList changes to be (a, b, d), then the
     * evaluator will see that the first dep has changed, and call the {@link #compute} method to
     * re-evaluate from scratch, without considering the dep group of {a, b, c}.
     *
     * <p>Example of when not to use getValuesAndExceptions: A BestMatch value is built with key
     * &lt;potentialMatchesRef, matchCriterion&gt;. The {@link #compute} method first calls
     * getValue(PotentialMatches.key(potentialMatchesRef) and retrieves potentialMatches. It then
     * iterates through potentialMatches, calling getValue on each potential match until it finds
     * one that satisfies matchCriterion. In this case, if potentialMatches is (a, b, c), it would
     * be <i>incorrect</i> to call getValuesAndExceptions({a, b, c}), because it is not known yet
     * whether requesting b or c will be necessary -- if a matches, then we will never call b or c.

     * Returns (or creates and returns) a "state" object to assist with temporary computations for
     * the {@link SkyKey} associated with this {@link Environment}.
     *
     * <p>The {@link SkyKeyComputeState} will either be freshly created via the given {@link
     * Supplier}, or will be the same exact instance used on the previous call to this method for
     * the same {@link SkyKey}. This allows {@link SkyFunction} implementations to avoid redoing the
     * same intermediate work over-and-over again on each {@link #compute} call for the same {@link
     * SkyKey}, due to missing Skyframe dependencies. For example,
     *
     * <pre>
     *   class MyFunction implements SkyFunction {
     *     public SkyValue compute(SkyKey skyKey, Environment env) throws InterruptedException {
     *       int x = (Integer) skyKey.argument();
     *       SkyKey myDependencyKey = getSkyKeyForValue(someExpensiveComputation(x));
     *       SkyValue myDependencyValue = env.getValue(myDependencyKey);
     *       if (env.valuesMissing()) {
     *         return null;
     *       }
     *       return createMyValue(myDependencyValue);
     *     }
     *   }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>If the dependency was missing, then we'll end up evaluating {@code
     * someExpensiveComputation(x)} twice, once on the initial call to {@link #compute} and then
     * again on the subsequent call after the dependency was computed.
     *
     * <p>To fix this, we can use a mutable {@link SkyKeyComputeState} implementation and store the
     * result of {@code someExpensiveComputation(x)} in there:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   class MyFunction implements SkyFunction {
     *     private static class State implements SkyKeyComputeState {
     *       private Integer result;
     *     }
     *
     *     public SkyValue compute(SkyKey skyKey, Environment env) throws InterruptedException {
     *       int x = (Integer) skyKey.argument();
     *       State state = env.getState(State::new);
     *       if (state.result == null) {
     *         state.result = someExpensiveComputation(x);
     *       }
     *       SkyKey myDependencyKey = getSkyKeyForValue(state.result);
     *       SkyValue myDependencyValue = env.getValue(myDependencyKey);
     *       if (env.valuesMissing()) {
     *         return null;
     *       }
     *       return createMyValue(myDependencyValue);
     *     }
     *   }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Now {@code someExpensiveComputation(x)} gets called exactly once for each {@code x}!
     *
     * <p>Important: There's no guarantee the {@link SkyKeyComputeState} instance will be the same
     * exact instance used on the previous call to this method for the same {@link SkyKey}. The
     * above example was just illustrating the best-case outcome. Therefore, {@link SkyFunction}
     * implementations should make use of this feature only as a performance optimization.
     *
     * <p>Note that {@link SkyKeyComputeState#close()} allows us to hold on to other kinds of
     * external resources and clean them up when necessary, but see the Javadoc there for caveats.
     *
     * <p>A notable example of the above note is that if {@link #compute} returns a {@link Reset}
     * then a call to {@link #getState} on the subsequent call to {@link #compute} will definitely
     * use the {@code stateSupplier}. It's important that Skyframe do this because {@link Reset}
     * indicates that work should be redone, and so it'd be wrong to reuse work from the previous
     * {@link #compute} call.
