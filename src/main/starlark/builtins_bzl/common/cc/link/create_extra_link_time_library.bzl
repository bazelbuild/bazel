Extra link-time library functionality.

CcInfo maintains a list of extra libraries to include in a link. These are non-C++ libraries that
are built from inputs gathered from all the dependencies. The dependencies have no way to
coordinate, so each one will add an ExtraLinkTimeLibrary to its CcLinkingContextInfo.
