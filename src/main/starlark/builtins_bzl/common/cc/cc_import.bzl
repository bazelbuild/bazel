<p>
<code>cc_import</code> rules allows users to import precompiled C/C++ libraries.
</p>

<p>
The following are the typical use cases: <br/>

1. Linking a static library
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  static_library = "libmylib.a",
  # If alwayslink is turned on,
  # libmylib.a will be forcely linked into any binary that depends on it.
  # alwayslink = True,
)
</code></pre>

2. Linking a shared library (Unix)
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",
)
</code></pre>

3. Linking a shared library with interface library

<p>On Unix:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  # libmylib.ifso is an interface library for libmylib.so which will be passed to linker
  interface_library = "libmylib.ifso",
  # libmylib.so will be available for runtime
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",

<p>On Windows:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(

  # mylib.lib is an import library for mylib.dll which will be passed to linker
  interface_library = "mylib.lib",
  # mylib.dll will be available for runtime
  shared_library = "mylib.dll",
)
</code></pre>

4. Linking a shared library with <code>system_provided=True</code>

<p>On Unix:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  interface_library = "libmylib.ifso", # Or we can also use libmylib.so as its own interface library
  # libmylib.so is provided by system environment, for example it can be found in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  # This indicates that Bazel is not responsible for making libmylib.so available.
  system_provided = True,

  # mylib.dll is provided by system environment, for example it can be found in PATH.
  # This indicates that Bazel is not responsible for making mylib.dll available.

5. Linking to static or shared library

  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  static_library = "libmylib.a",
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",

<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  static_library = "libmylib.lib", # A normal static library
  interface_library = "mylib.lib", # An import library for mylib.dll
  shared_library = "mylib.dll",
)
</code></pre>

<p>The remaining is the same on Unix and Windows:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
# first will link to libmylib.a (or libmylib.lib)
cc_binary(
  name = "first",
  srcs = ["first.cc"],
  deps = [":mylib"],

<p>
<code>cc_import</code> supports an include attribute. For example:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
