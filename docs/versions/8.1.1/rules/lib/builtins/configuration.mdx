This object holds information about the environment in which the build is running. See the [Rules page](https://bazel.build/versions/8.1.1/extending/rules#configurations) for more on the general concept of configurations.

## coverage\_enabled

```
bool configuration.coverage_enabled
```

A boolean that tells whether code coverage is enabled for this run. Note that this does not compute whether a specific rule should be instrumented for code coverage data collection. For that, see the [`ctx.coverage_instrumented`](../builtins/ctx#coverage_instrumented) function.

## default\_shell\_env

```
dict configuration.default_shell_env
```

A dictionary representing the static local shell environment. It maps variables to their values (strings).

## host\_path\_separator

```
string configuration.host_path_separator
```

Returns the separator for PATH environment variable, which is ':' on Unix.

## test\_env

```
dict configuration.test_env
```

A dictionary containing user-specified test environment variables and their values, as set by the --test\_env options. DO NOT USE! This is not the complete environment!
