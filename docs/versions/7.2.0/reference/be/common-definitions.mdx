<h2 id='sh-tokenization'>Bourne shell tokenization</h2>
<p>
  Certain string attributes of some rules are split into multiple
  words according to the tokenization rules of the Bourne shell:
  unquoted spaces delimit separate words, and single- and
  double-quotes characters and backslashes are used to prevent
  tokenization.
</p>
<p>
  Those attributes that are subject to this tokenization are
  explicitly indicated as such in their definitions in this document.
</p>
<p>
  Attributes subject to "Make" variable expansion and Bourne shell
  tokenization are typically used for passing arbitrary options to
  compilers and other tools. Examples of such attributes are
  <code>cc_library.copts</code> and <code>java_library.javacopts</code>.
  Together these substitutions allow a
  single string variable to expand into a configuration-specific list
  of option words.
</p>

<h2 id='label-expansion'>Label expansion</h2>
<p>
  Some string attributes of a very few rules are subject to label
  expansion: if those strings contain a valid label as a
  substring, such as <code>//mypkg:target</code>, and that label is a
  declared prerequisite of the current rule, it is expanded into the
  pathname of the file represented by the
  <a href="https://bazel.build/versions/7.2.0/reference/glossary#target">target</a>
  <code>//mypkg:target</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Example attributes include <code>genrule.cmd</code> and
  <code>cc_binary.linkopts</code>.  The details may vary significantly in
  each case, over such issues as: whether relative labels are
  expanded; how labels that expand to multiple files are
  treated, etc.  Consult the rule attribute documentation for
  specifics.
</p>


<h2 id="typical-attributes">Typical attributes defined by most build rules</h2>

<p>This section describes attributes that are defined by many build rules,
but not all.
</p>

        <td><a name="common.data"></a>
<p>List of <a href="/versions/7.2.0/concepts/labels">labels</a>; default is <code>[]</code></p>

<p>
Files needed by this rule at runtime. May list file or rule targets. Generally
allows any target.
</p>

<p>
The default outputs and runfiles of targets in the <code>data</code> attribute
should appear in the <code>*.runfiles</code> area of any executable which is
output by or has a runtime dependency on this target. This may include data
files or binaries used when this target's
<a href="#typical.srcs"><code>srcs</code></a> are executed. See the
<a href="/versions/7.2.0/concepts/dependencies#data-dependencies">data dependencies</a>
section for more information about how to depend on and use data files.
</p>

<p>
New rules should define a <code>data</code> attribute if they process
inputs which might use other inputs at runtime. Rules' implementation functions
must also <a href="https://bazel.build/versions/7.2.0/rules/rules#runfiles">populate the target's
runfiles</a> from the outputs and runfiles of any <code>data</code> attribute,
as well as runfiles from any dependency attribute which provides either
source code or runtime dependencies.

        <td><a name="common.deps"></a>
<p>List of <a href="/versions/7.2.0/concepts/labels">labels</a>; default is <code>[]</code></p>

<p>
Dependencies for this target. Generally should only list rule targets. (Though
some rules permit files to be listed directly in <code>deps</code>, this
should be avoided when possible.)
</p>

<p>
Language-specific rules generally limit the listed targets to those with
specific <a href="https://bazel.build/versions/7.2.0/extending/rules#providers">providers</a>.</p>

<p>
The precise semantics of what it means for a target to depend on another using
<code>deps</code> are specific to the kind of rule, and the rule-specific
documentation goes into more detail. For rules which process source code,
<code>deps</code> generally specifies code dependencies used by the code in
<a href="#typical.srcs"><code>srcs</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
Most often, a <code>deps</code> dependency is used to allow one module to use
symbols defined in another module written in the same programming language and
separately compiled.  Cross-language dependencies are also permitted in many
cases: For example, a <code>java_library</code> target may depend on C++ code
in a <code>cc_library</code> target, by listing the latter in the
<code>deps</code> attribute.  See the definition of
<a href="/versions/7.2.0/concepts/build-ref#deps">dependencies</a>
for more information.

may list rule targets (like <code>filegroup</code> or <code>genrule</code>) to
include their default outputs.
</p>

<p>
Language-specific rules often require that the listed files have particular
file extensions.

<h2 id="common-attributes">Attributes common to all build rules</h2>

<p>This section describes attributes that are implicitly added to all build
rules.
</p>

    <colgroup>
      <col class="col-param" />
      <col class="param-description" />

  <a href="#configurable-attributes">nonconfigurable</a>; default is <code>[]</code></p>

<p>
The list of environments this target can be built for, in addition to
default-supported environments.
</p>

<p>
This is part of Bazel's constraint system, which lets users declare which
targets can and cannot depend on each other. For example, externally deployable
binaries shouldn't depend on libraries with company-secret code. See
<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/constraints/ConstraintSemantics.java#L46">

      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td id="common.deprecation"><code>deprecation</code></td>
        <td><p>String; <a href="#configurable-attributes">nonconfigurable</a>; default is <code>None</code></p>

<p>
An explanatory warning message associated with this target.
Typically this is used to notify users that a target has become obsolete,
or has become superseded by another rule, is private to a package, or is
perhaps considered harmful for some reason. It is a good idea to include
some reference (like a webpage, a bug number or example migration CLs) so
that one can easily find out what changes are required to avoid the message.
If there is a new target that can be used as a drop in replacement, it is a
good idea to just migrate all users of the old target.
</p>

<p>
This attribute has no effect on the way things are built, but it
may affect a build tool's diagnostic output.  The build tool issues a
warning when a rule with a <code>deprecation</code> attribute is
depended upon by a target in another package.
</p>

<p>
Intra-package dependencies are exempt from this warning, so that,
for example, building the tests of a deprecated rule does not
encounter a warning.
</p>

<p>
If a deprecated target depends on another deprecated target, no warning
message is issued.
</p>

<p>
Once people have stopped using it, the target can be removed.

<p>This <code>features</code> attribute is combined with the <a href="/versions/7.2.0/reference/be/functions.html#package">
package</a> level <code>features</code> attribute. For example, if
the features ["a", "b"] are enabled on the package level, and a target's
<code>features</code> attribute contains ["-a", "c"], the features enabled for the
rule will be "b" and "c".

        <td><p>
  List of strings; <a href="#configurable-attributes">nonconfigurable</a>;
  default is <code>[]</code>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Tags</i> can be used on any rule. <i>Tags</i> on test and
  <code>test_suite</code> rules are useful for categorizing the tests.
  <i>Tags</i> on non-test targets are used to control sandboxed execution of
  <code>genrule</code>s and

<a href="/versions/7.2.0/rules/concepts">Starlark</a>
  actions, and for parsing by humans and/or external tools.
</p>

<p>
  Bazel modifies the behavior of its sandboxing code if it finds the following
  keywords in the <code>tags</code> attribute of any test or <code>genrule</code>
  target, or the keys of <code>execution_requirements</code> for any Starlark
  action.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>no-sandbox</code> keyword results in the action or test never being
    sandboxed; it can still be cached or run remotely - use <code>no-cache</code>
    or <code>no-remote</code> to prevent either or both of those.
  </li>
  <li><code>no-cache</code> keyword results in the action or test never being
    cached (remotely or locally)
  </li>
    <li><code>no-remote-cache</code> keyword results in the action or test never being
    cached remotely (but it may be cached locally; it may also be executed remotely).
    Note: for the purposes of this tag, the disk-cache is considered a local cache, whereas
    the http and gRPC caches are considered remote.
    If a combination of local disk cache and remote cache are used (combined cache),
    it's treated as a remote cache and disabled entirely unless <code>--incompatible_remote_results_ignore_disk</code>
    is set in which case the local components will be used.
  </li>
    <li><code>no-remote-exec</code> keyword results in the action or test never being
    executed remotely (but it may be cached remotely).
  </li>

  <li><code>no-remote</code> keyword prevents the action or test from being executed remotely or
    cached remotely. This is equivalent to using both
    <code>no-remote-cache</code> and <code>no-remote-exec</code>.
      </li>
   <li><code>no-remote-cache-upload</code> keyword disables upload part of remote caching of a spawn.
     it does not disable remote execution.
  </li>
    <li><code>local</code> keyword precludes the action or test from being remotely cached,
    remotely executed, or run inside the sandbox.
    For genrules and tests, marking the rule with the <code>local = True</code>
    attribute has the same effect.
  </li>

    <li><code>requires-network</code> keyword allows access to the external
    network from inside the sandbox.  This tag only has an effect if sandboxing
    is enabled.
  </li>

  <li><code>block-network</code> keyword blocks access to the external
    network from inside the sandbox. In this case, only communication
    with localhost is allowed. This tag only has an effect if sandboxing is
    enabled.
  </li>

  <li><code>requires-fakeroot</code> runs the test or action as uid and gid 0 (i.e., the root
    user). This is only supported on Linux. This tag takes precedence over the
    <code class='flag'>--sandbox_fake_username</code> command-line option.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <i>Tags</i> on tests are generally used to annotate a test's role in your
  debug and release process.  Typically, tags are most useful for C++ and Python
  tests, which lack any runtime annotation ability.  The use of tags and size
  elements gives flexibility in assembling suites of tests based around codebase
  check-in policy.
</p>

<p>
  Bazel modifies test running behavior if it finds the following keywords in the
  <code>tags</code> attribute of the test rule:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>exclusive</code> will force the test to be run in the
    &quot;exclusive&quot; mode, ensuring that no other tests are running at the
    same time. Such tests will be executed in serial fashion after all build
    activity and non-exclusive tests have been completed. Remote execution is
    disabled for such tests because Bazel doesn't have control over what's
    running on a remote machine.
  </li>

  <li><code>exclusive-if-local</code> will force the test to be run in the
    &quot;exclusive&quot; mode if it is executed locally, but will run the test in parallel if it's
    executed remotely.
  </li>

  <li><code>manual</code> keyword will exclude the target from expansion of target pattern wildcards
    (<code>...</code>, <code>:*</code>, <code>:all</code>, etc.) and <code>test_suite</code> rules
    which do not list the test explicitly when computing the set of top-level targets to build/run
    for the <code>build</code>, <code>test</code>, and <code>coverage</code> commands. It does not
    affect target wildcard or test suite expansion in other contexts, including the
    <code>query</code> command. Note that <code>manual</code> does not imply that a target should
    not be built/run automatically by continuous build/test systems. For example, it may be
    desirable to exclude a target from <code>bazel test ...</code> because it requires specific
    Bazel flags, but still have it included in properly-configured presubmit or continuous test
    runs.

      </li>

  <li><code>external</code> keyword will force test to be unconditionally
    executed (regardless of <code class='flag'>--cache_test_results</code>
    value).
  </li>

  </ul>

</p>

<p>
A list of
<code><a href="platform.html#constraint_value">constraint_value</a></code>s
that must be present in the target platform for this target to be considered
<em>compatible</em>. This is in addition to any constraints already set by the
rule type. If the target platform does not satisfy all listed constraints then
the target is considered <em>incompatible</em>. Incompatible targets are
skipped for building and testing when the target pattern is expanded
(e.g. <code>//...</code>, <code>:all</code>). When explicitly specified on the
command line, incompatible targets cause Bazel to print an error and cause a
build or test failure.
</p>

<p>
Targets that transitively depend on incompatible targets are themselves
considered incompatible. They are also skipped for building and testing.
</p>

<p>
An empty list (which is the default) signifies that the target is compatible
with all platforms.
<p>

<p>
All rules other than <a href="workspace.html">Workspace Rules</a> support this
attribute.
For some rules this attribute has no effect. For example, specifying
<code>target_compatible_with</code> for a
<code><a href="c-cpp.html#cc_toolchain">cc_toolchain</a></code> is not useful.

  except for test and test suite targets</p>

<p>
If <code>True</code>, only testonly targets (such as tests) can depend on this target.
</p>

<p>
Equivalently, a rule that is not <code>testonly</code> is not allowed to
depend on any rule that is <code>testonly</code>.
</p>

<p>
Tests (<code>*_test</code> rules)
and test suites (<a href="/versions/7.2.0/reference/be/general.html#test_suite">test_suite</a> rules)
are <code>testonly</code> by default.
</p>

<p>
This attribute is intended to mean that the target should not be
contained in binaries that are released to production.
</p>

<p>
Because testonly is enforced at build time, not run time, and propagates
virally through the dependency tree, it should be applied judiciously. For
example, stubs and fakes that
are useful for unit tests may also be useful for integration tests
involving the same binaries that will be released to production, and
therefore should probably not be marked testonly. Conversely, rules that
are dangerous to even link in, perhaps because they unconditionally
override normal behavior, should definitely be marked testonly.

  default is <code>"medium"</code></p>

<p>Specifies a test target's "heaviness": how much time/resources it needs to run.</p>

<p>Unit tests are considered "small", integration tests "medium", and end-to-end tests "large" or
"enormous". Bazel uses the size to determine a default timeout, which can be overridden using the
<code>timeout</code> attribute. The timeout is for all tests in the BUILD target, not for each
individual test. When the test is run locally, the <code>size</code> is additionally used for
scheduling purposes: Bazel tries to respect <code>--local_{ram,cpu}_resources</code> and not
overwhelm the local machine by running lots of heavy tests at the same time.</p>

<p>Test sizes correspond to the following default timeouts and assumed peak local resource
usages:</p>

<table style="width: 100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Size</th>
    <th>RAM (in MB)</th>
    <th>CPU (in CPU cores)</th>
    <th>Default timeout</th>

    <td>800</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>eternal (60 minutes)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The environment variable <code>
<a href="/versions/7.2.0/reference/test-encyclopedia#initial-conditions">TEST_SIZE</a>
</code> will be set to the
value of this attribute when spawning the test.</p>

  from the test's <code>size</code> attribute</code></p>

<p>
How long the test is expected to run before returning.
</p>

<p>
While a test's size attribute controls resource estimation, a test's
timeout may be set independently.  If not explicitly specified, the
timeout is based on the <a href="#test.size">test's size</a>. The test
timeout can be overridden with the <code>--test_timeout</code> flag, e.g. for
running under certain conditions which are known to be slow. Test timeout values
correspond to the following time periods:
</p>

<table style="width: 100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Timeout Value</th>
    <th>Time Period</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>short</td>

  <tr>
    <td>long</td>
    <td>15 minutes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>eternal</td>
    <td>60 minutes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
For times other than the above, the test timeout can be overridden with the
<code>--test_timeout</code> bazel flag, e.g. for manually running under
conditions which are known to be slow. The <code>--test_timeout</code> values
are in seconds. For example <code>--test_timeout=120</code> will set the test
timeout to two minutes.
</p>

<p>The environment variable <code>
<a href="/versions/7.2.0/reference/test-encyclopedia#initial-conditions">TEST_TIMEOUT</a>
</code> will be set to the test timeout (in seconds) when spawning the test.</p>

<p>
Marks test as flaky.
</p>

<p>
If set, executes the test up to three times, marking it as failed only if it
fails each time. By default, this attribute is set to False and the test is
executed only once. Note, that use of this attribute is generally discouraged -
tests should pass reliably when their assertions are upheld.

        <td><p>Non-negative integer less than or equal to 50; default is <code>-1</code></p>

<p>Specifies the number of parallel shards
to use to run the test.</p>

<p>If set, this value will override any heuristics used to determine the number of
parallel shards with which to run the test. Note that for some test
rules, this parameter may be required to enable sharding
in the first place. Also see <code>--test_sharding_strategy</code>.</p>

<p>If test sharding is enabled, the environment variable <code>
<a href="/versions/7.2.0/reference/test-encyclopedia#initial-conditions">TEST_TOTAL_SHARDS</a>
</code> will be set to this value when spawning the test.</p>

<p>Sharding requires the test runner to support the test sharding protocol.
If it does not, then it will most likely run every test in every shard, which
is not what you want.</p>

<h2 id="configurable-attributes">Configurable attributes</h2>

<p>
  Most attributes are "configurable", meaning that their values may change when
  the target is built in different ways. Specifically, configurable attributes
  may vary based on the flags passed to the Bazel command line, or what
  downstream dependency is requesting the target. This can be used, for
  instance, to customize the target for multiple platforms or compilation modes.
</p>

<p>
  The following example declares different sources for different target
  architectures. Running <code>bazel build :multiplatform_lib --cpu x86</code>
  will build the target using <code>x86_impl.cc</code>, while substituting
  <code>--cpu arm</code> will instead cause it to use <code>arm_impl.cc</code>.
</p>

<pre class="code">
cc_library(
    name = "multiplatform_lib",
    srcs = select({
        ":x86_mode": ["x86_impl.cc"],
        ":arm_mode": ["arm_impl.cc"]
    })
)
config_setting(
    name = "x86_mode",
    values = { "cpu": "x86" }
)
config_setting(
    name = "arm_mode",
    values = { "cpu": "arm" }
)
</pre>

<p>
  The <a href="/versions/7.2.0/reference/be/functions.html#select"><code>select()</code></a> function
  chooses among different alternative values for a configurable attribute based
  on which <a href="/versions/7.2.0/reference/be/general.html#config_setting"><code>config_setting</code></a>
  or <a href="/versions/7.2.0/reference/be/platforms-and-toolchains.html#constraint_value"><code>constraint_value</code></a>
  criteria the target's configuration satisfies.
</p>

<p>
  Bazel evaluates configurable attributes after processing macros and before
  processing rules (technically, between the
  <a href="https://bazel.build/versions/7.2.0/rules/concepts#evaluation-model">
  loading and analysis phases</a>).
  Any processing before <code>select()</code> evaluation doesn't know which
  branch the <code>select()</code> chooses. Macros, for example, can't change
  their behavior based on the chosen branch, and <code>bazel query</code> can
  only make conservative guesses about a target's configurable dependencies. See
  <a href="https://bazel.build/versions/7.2.0/docs/configurable-attributes#faq">
  this FAQ</a>
  for more on using <code>select()</code> with rules and macros.
</p>

<p>
  Attributes marked <code>nonconfigurable</code> in their documentation cannot
  use this feature. Usually an attribute is nonconfigurable because Bazel
  internally needs to know its value before it can determine how to resolve a
  <code>select()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  See <a href="https://bazel.build/versions/7.2.0/docs/configurable-attributes">
  Configurable Build Attributes</a> for a detailed overview.
</p>

<h2 id="implicit-outputs">Implicit output targets</h2>

<p>
  <i>Implicit outputs in C++ are deprecated. Please refrain from using it
  in other languages where possible. We don't have a deprecation path yet
  but they will eventually be deprecated too.</i>
</p>

<p>When you define a build rule in a BUILD file, you are explicitly
  declaring a new, named rule target in a package.  Many build rule
  functions also <i>implicitly</i> entail one or more output file
  targets, whose contents and meaning are rule-specific.

  For example, when you explicitly declare a
  <code>java_binary(name='foo', ...)</code> rule, you are also
  <i>implicitly</i> declaring an output file
  target <code>foo_deploy.jar</code> as a member of the same package.
  (This particular target is a self-contained Java archive suitable
  for deployment.)
</p>

<p>
  Implicit output targets are first-class members of the global
  target graph.  Just like other targets, they are built on demand,
  either when specified in the top-level built command, or when they
  are necessary prerequisites for other build targets.  They can be
  referenced as dependencies in BUILD files, and can be observed in
  the output of analysis tools such as <code>bazel query</code>.
</p>

<p>
  For each kind of build rule, the rule's documentation contains a
  special section detailing the names and contents of any implicit
  outputs entailed by a declaration of that kind of rule.
</p>

<p>
  An important but somewhat subtle distinction between the
  two namespaces used by the build system:
  <a href="/versions/7.2.0/concepts/labels">labels</a> identify <em>targets</em>,
  which may be rules or files, and file targets may be divided into
  either source (or input) file targets and derived (or output) file
  targets.  These are the things you can mention in BUILD files,
  build from the command-line, or examine using <code>bazel query</code>;
  this is the <em>target namespace</em>.  Each file target corresponds
  to one actual file on disk (the "file system namespace"); each rule
  target may correspond to zero, one or more actual files on disk.
  There may be files on disk that have no corresponding target; for
  example, <code>.o</code> object files produced during C++ compilation
  cannot be referenced from within BUILD files or from the command line.
  In this way, the build tool may hide certain implementation details of
  how it does its job. This is explained more fully in
  the <a href="/versions/7.2.0/concepts/build-ref">BUILD Concept Reference</a>.
