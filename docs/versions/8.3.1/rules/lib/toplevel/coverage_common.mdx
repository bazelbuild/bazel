```
InstrumentedFilesInfo coverage_common.instrumented_files_info(ctx, *, source_attributes=[], dependency_attributes=[], extensions=None, metadata_files=[])
```

Creates a new [InstrumentedFilesInfo](../providers/InstrumentedFilesInfo) instance. Use this provider to communicate coverage-related attributes of the current build rule.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ctx` | [ctx](../builtins/ctx); required  The rule context. |
| `source_attributes` | [sequence](../core/list); default is `[]`  A list of attribute names which contain source files processed by this rule. |
| `dependency_attributes` | [sequence](../core/list); default is `[]`  A list of attribute names which might provide runtime dependencies (either code dependencies or runfiles). |
| `extensions` | [sequence](../core/list) of [string](../core/string)s; or `None`; default is `None`  File extensions used to filter files from source\_attributes. For example, 'js'. If not provided (or None), then all files from source\_attributes will be added to instrumented files, if an empty list is provided, then no files from source attributes will be added. |
| `metadata_files` | [sequence](../core/list) of [File](../builtins/File)s; default is `[]`  Additional files required to generate coverage LCOV files after code execution. e.g. .gcno files for C++. |
