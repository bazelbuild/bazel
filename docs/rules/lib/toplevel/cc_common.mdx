```

 Creates a feature\_configuration instance. Requires the cpp configuration fragment.


### Parameters

ParameterDescription`ctx`[ctx](../builtins/ctx.html);
 required

 The rule context.
 `cc_toolchain`
 Info;
 required

 cc\_toolchain for which we configure features.
 `language`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;

```

 Creates a `CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider


### Parameters

ParameterDescription`ctx`[ctx](../builtins/ctx.html);
 required

 The rule context.
 `features`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 Contains all flag specifications for one feature.

Arguments:

`name`: The feature's name. It is possible to introduce a feature without a change to Bazel by adding a 'feature' section to the toolchain and adding the corresponding string as feature in the `BUILD` file.

`enabled`: If 'True', this feature is enabled unless a rule type explicitly marks it as unsupported.

`flag_sets`: A FlagSet list. If the given feature is enabled, the flag sets will be applied for the actions are specified for.

`env_sets`: an EnvSet list. If the given feature is enabled, the env sets will be applied for the actions they are specified for.

`requires`: A list of feature sets defining when this feature is supported by the toolchain. The feature is supported if any of the feature sets fully apply, that is, when all features of a feature set are enabled. If `requires` is omitted, the feature is supported independently of which other features are enabled. Use this for example to filter flags depending on the build mode enabled (opt / fastbuild / dbg).

`implies`: A string list of features or action configs that are automatically enabled when this feature is enabled. If any of the implied features or action configs cannot be enabled, this feature will (silently) not be enabled either.

`provides`: A list of names this feature conflicts with.

A feature cannot be enabled if:

\- `provides` contains the name of a different feature or action config that we want to enable.

\- `provides` contains the same value as a 'provides' in a different feature or action config that we want to enable. Use this in order to ensure that incompatible features cannot be accidentally activated at the same time, leading to hard to diagnose compiler errors.
 `action_configs`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 An action config corresponds to a Bazel action, and allows selection of a tool based on activated features. Action config activation occurs by the same semantics as features: a feature can 'require' or 'imply' an action config in the same way that it would another feature.

Arguments:

`action_name`: The name of the Bazel action that this config applies to, e.g. 'c-compile' or 'c-module-compile'.

`enabled`: If 'True', this action is enabled unless a rule type explicitly marks it as unsupported.

`tools`: The tool applied to the action will be the first tool with a feature set that matches the feature configuration. An error will be thrown if no tool matches a provided feature configuration - for that reason, it's a good idea to provide a default tool with an empty feature set.

`flag_sets`: If the given action config is enabled, the flag sets will be applied to the corresponding action.

`implies`: A list of features or action configs that are automatically enabled when this action config is enabled. If any of the implied features or action configs cannot be enabled, this action config will (silently) not be enabled either.

`artifact_name_patterns`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 The name for an artifact of a given category of input or output artifacts to an action.

Arguments:

`category_name`: The category of artifacts that this selection applies to. This field is compared against a list of categories defined in Bazel. Example categories include "linked\_output" or the artifact for this selection. Together with the extension it is used to create an artifact name based on the target name.

`extension`: The extension for creating the artifact for this selection. Together with the prefix it is used to create an artifact name based on the target name.

`cxx_builtin_include_directories`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

Built-in include directories for C++ compilation. These should be the exact paths used by the compiler, and are generally relative to the exec root.

The paths used by the compiler can be determined by 'gcc -E -xc++ - -v'.

We currently use the C++ paths also for C compilation, which is safe as long as there are no name clashes between C++ and C header files.

Relative paths are resolved relative to the configuration file directory.

If the compiler has --sysroot support, then these paths should use %sysroot% rather than the include path, and specify the sysroot attribute in order to give blaze the information necessary to make the correct replacements.

`toolchain_identifier`[string](../core/string.html);
 required

The unique identifier of the toolchain within the crosstool release. It must be possible to use this as a directory name in a path.

It has to match the following regex: \[a-zA-Z\_\]\[\\.\\- \\w\]\*

`host_system_name`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 Ignored.
 `target_system_name`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 Deprecated. The GNU System Name. The string is exposed to CcToolchainInfo.target\_gnu\_system\_name.
 `target_cpu`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 Deprecated: Use cpu based constraints instead. If the string is "k8", \`target\_cpu\` will be omitted from the filename of raw FDO profile data.
 `target_libc`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 Deprecated: Use OS based constraints instead. The libc version string (e.g. "glibc-2.2.2"). If the string is "macosx", platform is assumed to be MacOS. Otherwise, Linux. The string is exposed to CcToolchainInfo.libc.
 `compiler`[string](../core/string.html);
 required

 The compiler string (e.g. "gcc"). The current toolchain's compiler is exposed to \`@bazel\_tools//tools/cpp:compiler (compiler\_flag)\` as a flag value. Targets that require compiler-specific flags can use the config\_settings in https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules\_cc/blob/main/cc/compiler/BUILD in select() statements or create custom config\_setting if the existing settings don't suffice.
 `abi_version`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 The abi in use, which is a gcc version. E.g.: "gcc-3.4". The string is set to C++ toolchain variable ABI.
 `abi_libc_version`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 The glibc version used by the abi we're using. The string is set to C++ toolchain variable ABI\_LIBC\_VERSION.
 `tool_paths`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 Tool locations.

Arguments:

`name`: Name of the tool.

`path`: Location of the tool; Can be absolute path (in case of non hermetic toolchain), or path relative to the cc\_toolchain's package.

`make_variables`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 A make variable that is made accessible to rules.
 `builtin_sysroot`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 The built-in sysroot. If this attribute is not present, Bazel does not allow using a different sysroot, i.e. through the --grte\_top option.

```

 Should be used for C++ transitive linking.


### Parameters

ParameterDescription`actions`[actions](../builtins/actions.html);
 required

`actions` object.
 `name`[string](../core/string.html);
 required

 This is used for naming the output artifacts of actions created by this method.
 `feature_configuration`[FeatureConfiguration](../builtins/FeatureConfiguration.html);
 required

`feature_configuration` to be queried.
 `cc_toolchain`
 Info;
 required

`CcToolchainInfo` provider to be used.
 `language`[string](../core/string.html);
 default is `'c++'`

 Only C++ supported for now. Do not use this parameter.
 `output_type`[string](../core/string.html);
 default is `'executable'`

 Can be either 'executable' or 'dynamic\_library'.
 `link_deps_statically`[bool](../core/bool.html);
 default is `True`

 True to link dependencies statically, False dynamically.
 `compilation_outputs`[CcCompilationOutputs](../builtins/CcCompilationOutputs.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 Compilation outputs containing object files to link.
 `linking_contexts`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 Linking contexts from dependencies to be linked into the linking context generated by this rule.
 `user_link_flags`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 Additional list of linker options.
 `stamp`[int](../core/int.html);
 default is `0`

 Whether to include build information in the linked executable, if output\_type is 'executable'. If 1, build information is always included. If 0 (the default build information is always excluded. If -1, uses the default behavior, which may be overridden by the --\[no\]stamp flag. This should be unset (or set to 0) when generating the executable output for test rules.
 `additional_inputs`[sequence](../core/list.html); or [depset](../builtins/depset.html);
 default is `[]`

 For additional inputs to the linking action, e.g.: linking scripts.
 `additional_outputs`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`
