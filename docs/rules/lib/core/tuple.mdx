The built-in tuple type. Example tuple expressions:

```
x = (1, 2, 3)
```

Accessing elements is possible using indexing (starts from `0`):

```
e = x[1]   # e == 2
```

Lists support the `+` operator to concatenate two tuples. Example:

```
x = (1, 2) + (3, 4)   # x == (1, 2, 3, 4)
x = ("a", "b")
x += ("c",)            # x == ("a", "b", "c")
```

Similar to lists, tuples support slice operations:

```
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')[1:3]   # ('b', 'c')
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')[::2]  # ('a', 'c')
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')[3:0:-1]  # ('d', 'c', 'b')
```

Tuples are immutable, therefore `x[1] = "a"` is not supported.
