title: 'template\_ctx'
---



A context object that is passed to the action template expansion function.

## Members

- [args](#args)
- [declare\_file](#declare_file)
- [run](#run)

## args

```
Args template_ctx.args()
```

 Returns an Args object that can be used to build memory-efficient command lines.



## declare\_file

```
File template_ctx.declare_file(filename, *, directory)
```

 Declares that implementation creates a file with the given filename within the specified directory.

Remember that in addition to declaring a file, you must separately create an action that emits the file. Creating that action will require passing the returned `File` object to the action's construction function.


### Parameters

ParameterDescription`filename`[string](../core/string.html);
 required

 The relative path of the file within the directory.
 `directory`[File](../builtins/File.html);
 required

 The directory in which the file should be created.


## run

```
None template_ctx.run(*, outputs, inputs=[], executable, tools=None, arguments=[], progress_message=None)
```

 Creates an action that runs an executable.


### Parameters

ParameterDescription`outputs`[sequence](../core/list.html) of [File](../builtins/File.html) s;
 required

 List of the output files of the action.
 `inputs`[sequence](../core/list.html) of [File](../builtins/File.html) s; or [depset](../builtins/depset.html);
 default is `[]`

 List or depset of the input files of the action.
 `executable`[File](../builtins/File.html); or [string](../core/string.html); or [FilesToRunProvider](../providers/FilesToRunProvider.html);
 required

 The executable file to be called by the action.
 `tools`[sequence](../core/list.html); or [depset](../builtins/depset.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 List or [`depset`](../builtins/depset.html) of any tools needed by the action. Tools are executable inputs that may have their own runfiles which are automatically made available to the action.

When a list is provided, it can be a heterogenous collection of:

- `File` s
- `FilesToRunProvider` instances
- `depset` s of `File` s

`File` s from [`ctx.executable`](../builtins/ctx#executable) and `FilesToRunProvider` s which are directly in the list will have their runfiles automatically added. All tools are implicitly added as inputs.

`arguments`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 Command line arguments of the action. Must be a list of strings or [`actions.args()`](#args) objects.
 `progress_message`[string](../core/string.html); or `None`;
 default is `None`

 Progress message to show to the user during the build.
