Represents a configuration transition across a dependency edge. For example, if `//package:foo` depends on `//package:bar` with a configuration transition, then the configuration of `//package:bar` (and its dependencies) will be `//package:foo`'s configuration plus the changes specified by the transition function.

```
transition transition(*, implementation, inputs, outputs)
```

 A transition that reads a set of input build settings and writes a set of output build settings.

Example:

```
def _transition_impl(settings, attr):
    # This transition just reads the current CPU value as a demonstration.
    # A real transition could incorporate this into its followup logic.
    current_cpu = settings["//command_line_option:cpu"]
    return {"//command_line_option:compilation_mode": "dbg"}

build_in_debug_mode = transition(
    implementation = _transition_impl,
    inputs = ["//command_line_option:cpu"],
    outputs = ["//command_line_option:compilation_mode"],
)
```

### Parameters

ParameterDescription`implementation`
 callable;
 required

 The function implementing this transition. This function always has two parameters: `settings` and `attr`. The `settings` param is a dictionary whose set of keys is defined by the inputs parameter. So, for each build setting `--//foo=bar`, if `inputs` contains `//foo`, `settings` will have an entry `settings['//foo']='bar'`.

The `attr` param is a reference to `ctx.attr`. This gives the implementation function access to the rule's attributes to make attribute-parameterized transitions possible.

This function must return a `dict` from build setting identifier to build setting value; this represents the configuration transition: for each entry in the returned `dict`, the transition updates that setting to the new value. All other settings are unchanged. This function can also return a `list` of `dict` s or a `dict` of `dict` s in the case of a split transition.


`inputs`[sequence](../core/list.html) of [string](../core/string.html) s;
 required

 List of build settings that can be read by this transition. This becomes the key set of the settings parameter of the implementation function parameter.
 `outputs`[sequence](../core/list.html) of [string](../core/string.html) s;
 required

 List of build settings that can be written by this transition. This must be a superset of the key set of the dictionary returned by this transition.
