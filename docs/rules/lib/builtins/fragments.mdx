A collection of configuration fragments available in the current rule implementation context. Access a specific fragment by its field name. For example, `ctx.fragments.java`

Only configuration fragments which are declared in the rule definition may be accessed in this collection.

See the [configuration fragment reference](../fragments.html) for a list of available fragments and the [rules documentation](https://bazel.build/extending/rules#configuration_fragments) for how to use them.
