## direct\_module\_maps

```
sequence ObjcProvider.direct_module_maps
```

 Module map files from this target directly (no transitive module maps). Used to enforce proper use of private header files and for Swift compilation.



## direct\_sources

```
sequence ObjcProvider.direct_sources
```

 All direct source files from this target (no transitive files), including any headers in the 'srcs' attribute.



## j2objc\_library

```
depset ObjcProvider.j2objc_library
```

 Static libraries that are built from J2ObjC-translated Java code.



## module\_map

```
depset ObjcProvider.module_map
```

 Clang module maps, used to enforce proper use of private header files.



## source

```
depset ObjcProvider.source
```

 All transitive source files.



## strict\_include

```
depset ObjcProvider.strict_include
```

 Non-propagated include search paths specified with '-I' on the command line. Also known as header search paths (and distinct from _user_ header search paths).



## umbrella\_header

```
depset ObjcProvider.umbrella_header
```

 Clang umbrella header. Public headers are #included in umbrella headers to be compatible with J2ObjC segmented headers.
