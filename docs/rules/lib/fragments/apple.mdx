A configuration fragment for Apple platforms.

## single\_arch\_cpu

```
string apple.single_arch_cpu
```

 The single "effective" architecture for this configuration (e.g., `i386` or `arm64`) in the context of rule logic that is only concerned with a single architecture (such as `objc_library`, which registers single-architecture compile actions).



## single\_arch\_platform

```
apple_platform apple.single_arch_platform
```

 The platform of the current configuration. This should only be invoked in a context where only a single architecture may be supported; consider [multi\_arch\_platform](#multi_arch_platform) for other cases.
